## Contents

**Hero Image Header Block**

Use this block in lieu of the core Cover Image block if you need to render your hero/cover background image in an actual `<header>` element with the post/page title automatically added in an `<h2>` on top.

## Installation

1.  Clone/download repo into `plugins/`
2.  Install deps and build (eg. `npm i && npm run build`)
3.  Activate it through the WordPress admin plugin interface
4.  Use the Hero Image Header block!

## Development

This project was bootstrapped with [Create Guten Block](https://github.com/ahmadawais/create-guten-block).

You can find the most recent version of the CGB guide [here](https://github.com/ahmadawais/create-guten-block). For ongoing development, use the following CGB scripts:

### ðŸ‘‰ `npm start`

- Use to compile and run the block in development mode.
- Watches for any changes and reports back any errors in your code.

### ðŸ‘‰ `npm run build`

- Use to build production code for your block inside `dist` folder.
- Runs once and reports back the gzip file sizes of the produced code.

### ðŸ‘‰ `npm run eject`

- Use to eject your plugin out of `create-guten-block`.
- Provides all the configurations so you can customize the project as you want.
- It's a one-way street, `eject` and you have to maintain everything yourself.
- You don't normally have to `eject` a project because by ejecting you lose the connection with `create-guten-block` and from there onwards you have to update and maintain all the dependencies on your own.
