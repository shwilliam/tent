## Installation

### 1. Download

Then add to your `wp-content` directory.

### 2. Install the dev dependencies

Run `npm install` **inside the theme directory** next to install the node modules you'll need for Gulp, etc.

### 3. Update the proxy in `gulpfile.js`

Lastly, be sure to update your `gulpfile.js` with the appropriate URL for the Browsersync proxy (so change `localhost[:port-here]/[your-dir-name-here]` to the appropriate localhost URL).
