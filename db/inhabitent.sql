Take in cafes, beer gardens, the Citadel Hill, a farmers market and more pubs than you can count! May is a lovely time of year on the peninsula with lots of sunshine and occasional shower. Be sure to check out the newly built Central Library downtown &#8211; a spectacular architectural feat. Spend the whole week in Halifax to take road trips to other beautiful parts of the province: wine tours, U-picks and quaint fishing villages can all be found within a few hours drive away from the capital.</p>\n<p>WordCamp has affordable accommodations if you want to stay close to the venue. More information can be <a href=\"https://2017.halifax.wordcamp.org/venue/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">found here</a>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>What To Expect At WordCamp Halifax</h2>\n<p>With a mere $25 price tag, attendees can expect to enjoy:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Catered lunch</li>\n<li>Swag bag with lots of goodies</li>\n<li>Happiness Bar where attendees can get one-on-one help with their website</li>\n<li>Lots of networking with people from a multitude of industries and skill levels</li>\n<li>25 local, national and international <a href=\"https://2017.halifax.wordcamp.org/speakers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">speakers</a></li>\n<li>21 <a href=\"https://2017.halifax.wordcamp.org/sessions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">informative sessions</a> in three tracks</li>\n<li>An After Party five minutes from the venue, with affordable bevvy&#8217;s &amp; snacks (you know how Haligonians love a good kitchen party!)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The team has worked hard to bring diverse programming to this inaugural WordCamp with three tracks of learning:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Content Creators:</strong> Easiest sessions.

Filed underÂ <a title=\"View all posts in Releases\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/category/releases/\" rel=\"category tag\">Releases</a>.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<div>\n<blockquote><p>Version 3.7 of WordPress, named â€œBasieâ€ in honor ofÂ <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count_basie\">Count Basie</a>, is availableÂ <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/download/\">for download</a>Â or update in your WordPress dashboard. This release features some of the most important architectural updates weâ€™ve made to date. Here are the big ones:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Updates while you sleep</strong>: With WordPress 3.7, you donâ€™t have to lift a finger to apply maintenance and security updates. Most sites are now able to automatically apply these updates in the background. The update process also has been made even more reliable and secure, with dozens of new checks and safeguards.</li>\n<li><strong>Stronger password recommendations</strong>: Your password is your siteâ€™s first line of defense. Itâ€™s best to create passwords that are complex, long, and unique. To that end, our password meter has been updated in WordPress 3.7 to recognize common mistakes that can weaken your password: dates, names, keyboard patterns (123456789), and even pop culture references.</li>\n<li><strong>Better global support</strong>: Localized versions of WordPress will receive faster and more complete translations. WordPress 3.7 adds support for automatically installing the right language files and keeping them up to date, a boon for the many millions who use WordPress in a language other than English.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For developers there are lots of options around how to control the new updates feature, including allowing it to handle major upgrades as well as minor ones, more sophisticated date query support, and multisite improvements.

More than 500 million websites use robots.txt files to talk to bots, according to Google&#8217;s data. Up until now, there has never been an official Internet standard, no documented specification for writing the rules correctly according to the protocol. Over the years, developers shared their various interpretations of the protocol, but this created many different ambiguous methods for controlling crawlers.</p>\n<p>Google is working together with Martijn Koster, the original author of the protocol, webmasters, and other search engines to <a href=\"https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2019/07/rep-id.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">create a proposal</a> to submit to the <a href=\"https://www.ietf.org/standards/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Internet Engineering Task Force</a> (IETF) for standardizing the REP:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The proposed REP draft reflects over 20 years of real world experience of relying on robots.txt rules, used both by Googlebot and other major crawlers, as well as about half a billion websites that rely on REP. These fine grained controls give the publisher the power to decide what they&#8217;d like to be crawled on their site and potentially shown to interested users. It doesn&#8217;t change the rules created in 1994, but rather defines essentially all undefined scenarios for robots.txt parsing and matching, and extends it for the modern web.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The proposed specification includes several major items that webmasters and developers will want to review. It extends the use of robots.txt to any URI-based transfer protocol (FTP, CoAP, et al), instead of limiting it to HTTP. It also implements a new maximum caching time of 24 hours and lets website owners update robots.txt whenever they choose, without having crawlers overload their sites with requests. If a previously accessible robots.txt file becomes inaccessible for whatever reason, crawlers will respect the known disallowed pages that were previously identified for &#8220;a reasonably long period of time.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Google has also <a href=\"https://opensource.googleblog.com/2019/07/googles-robotstxt-parser-is-now-open.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">open sourced</a> the C++ library it uses for parsing and matching rules in robots.txt files, along with a testing tool for testing the rules. Developers can use this parser to create parsers that use the proposed REP requirements. It has been updated to ensure that Googlebot only crawls what it&#8217;s allowed to and is now <a href=\"https://github.com/google/robotstxt\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">available on GitHub</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This library has been around for 20 years and it contains pieces of code that were written in the 90&#8217;s,&#8221; Google&#8217;s Search Open Sourcing team said in the <a href=\"https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2019/07/repp-oss.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">announcement</a>. &#8220;Since then, the library evolved; we learned a lot about how webmasters write robots.txt files and corner cases that we had to cover for, and added what we learned over the years also to the internet draft when it made sense.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Lizzi Harvey, who maintains Google&#8217;s Search developer docs, updated the robots.txt spec to match the REP draft. Check out the <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/search/reference/robots_txt#what-changed\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">full list of changes</a> if you want to compare your robots.txt file to the proposed spec.

I was â€œgiftedâ€ so learning came easy and I enjoyed it.Â  From ages 6 to 18, I went to competitive accelerated schools designed to churn out college students. It was a narrow path Iâ€™d been set on, without encouragement to explore beyond.</p>\n<p>Majoring in theater was a no-brainer. It was the only thing Iâ€™d done my whole life, so I figured I wouldnâ€™t get bored. My mom was a stage manager so it has always been easy to bring me to rehearsals with her when working a show. I ended up in close to 20 different productions between 5 and 13. Plus, Florida State University had a great theatre program and in-state tuition was cheap. So I went.</p>\n<p>But I wasnâ€™t there because I wanted to be. Iâ€™d gone simply because I felt I <i>had</i> to go to college, regardless of what I did when I got there. I liked theater a lot, but I didnâ€™t love it the way my classmates did. Self-doubt crept in. Depression overcame me. Anxiety and self-hatred took root. I stopped going to class. I isolated myself from my friends who &#8211; going through their own stuff &#8211;Â  were too busy to notice.</p>\n<p>At 19, I dropped out.</p>\n<h3>Straying from the path</h3>\n<p>With me, I took thousands in debt, a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, and a bruised ego. I wandered, directionless for the first time in my life.</p>\n<p>I felt like a failure. I did not know who or what I was anymore, I had no community and I belonged nowhere. I was crippled by my concurrent depression and lack of a diploma. What was my path now?</p>\n<p>My mother spent her whole life working in the arts and that made her happy. I wanted the same thing. But we were always pinching pennies. I didnâ€™t want that for myself, and I didnâ€™t want my kids to grow up with that burden. So I thought to myself, â€œWhat can I do thatâ€™s creative, wonâ€™t be boring, and can earn me an income?â€</p>\n<p>I donâ€™t remember if there was a lightbulb moment where I realized web design checked all my boxes. But that was there I landed.</p>\n<p>I started getting my toes wet with HTML and CSS, but coding didnâ€™t come easily to me. I didnâ€™t have a computer, so I would write out lines of code by hand in order to memorize syntax. It didnâ€™t click and just swam in front of my eyes. It was difficult, so I gave up.</p>\n<p>For a year and a half, I lived in a few different cities, from Ft Lauderdale all the way to Los Angeles, working some retail and food service jobs. I learned about customer service, the balance between maintenance and growth, and found myself more than a little bit fascinated by marketing.Â  I began to learn how to juggle the depression and anxiety that lived in my head.</p>\n<p>No matter where I went, web design was sitting in the back of my brain. I was shut down when I tried to suggest changes to the booking system of a salon I worked at. I found myself sketching redesigns of the website of the bar where I picked up shifts. I started learning again after moving back to Florida. This time, I found online resources like Udemy and CodeSchool and it all began to click.</p>\n<h3>Finding a new path</h3>\n<p>While I still didnâ€™t love code itself, I loved the idea of building something from nothing. It all hearkened back to theater: rallying the knowledge and experience of multiple people, laying out a plan, inventing some creative solutions along the way, iteration after iteration until it functions and yields a result, then presenting it as a living and breathing product. I had learned about story-telling via script analysis classes in college as well as spacing and color psychology. I had always been academic, so I found ease and comfort in things like databases and content writing. My intellectual and creative side were merging, dancing together in one elegant performance.</p>\n<p>In 2015, I applied for a web design internship at a small agency. It was here where WordPress and I first met. I was amazed that I could easily build websites with limited coding knowledge. I attended my first WordCamp in Miami, where I watched people like Morten Hendricksen and Michelle Schlup live what I wished I could be doing.</p>\n<p>I was promoted to a full employee in a poisonous environment. I had to work long hours and was accused of not being a team player if I didnâ€™t. I was guilt-tripped with gifts and compliments. I was asked to do tasks I hadnâ€™t been trained in and was berated when I struggled. I left one day after about a year, in tears. The despair, loneliness and frustration were unassailable.Â  I had failed, yet again, to move forward on the path I felt I belonged on.</p>\n<h3>Setting my own path</h3>\n<p>I had no savings and no car, so I was left with a choice: apply to work at the Wendyâ€™s that was walking distance up the street, or find a way to make money out of thin air. Taking inventory of my skills:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I knew WordPress</li>\n<li>I knew how <i>not</i> to run a business</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So I started building small sites for friends and family. I scrambled to learn how to invoice properly, how to handle contracts, how to get taxes paid. I googled a lot and failed often. But it was rewarding and creative, so I stuck to it.</p>\n<p>In 2017, I felt confident enough to apply to speak at WordCamp Miami. It had been 2 years since I had attended the first and I was floored when I was accepted.</p>\n<p>In the three years that I ran my business, I worked with clients from all over the world. I used WordPress daily to build and break, support and scale websites for other business owners like me. I wore every hat I could balance: CEO, CFO, designer, developer, marketer, and support staff in one.</p>\n<p>While I appeared â€œsuccessfulâ€ (whatever that means) I was paddling like crazy beneath the surface and was constantly stretched to my limit. I achieved decent work-life boundaries and found satisfaction in the work, but being depressed while running a business is easier said than done.</p>\n<p>In early 2019, as my bank account began to dry up, I began to seriously consider throwing in the towel.</p>\n<h3>A fork in the path</h3>\n<p>I spoke at WordCamp Miami that year. The entire camp buoyed my spirits; this time, there were faces and topics I recognized. I went with my friend, Louise Treadwell, who made the entire experience less frightening.</p>\n<p>And the universe was looking out for me. The very first person I met that day was Adam Warner.</p>\n<p>He saw my talk and I suppose he saw something in me that he liked. By the end of the conference, my head was swimming with the opportunity he had presented to me: to travel as a GoDaddy Pro Speaker Ambassador.</p>\n<p>I felt that electric sensation again of my two halves &#8211; academic and creative &#8211; merging. It was the first time the community had reached out and taken a firm, confident grasp of my hand. And I was in exactly the right spot to accept it.</p>\n<p>The idea of attending more WordCamps was thrilling. I vowed to myself that I would up my Twitter game. After all, all my WordCamp heroes were active on Twitter and I was desperate to be where the action was.</p>\n<p>I grabbed as many opportunities as I could to remain visible. I wrote blog posts and made YouTube videos to prove what I knew, to myself as much as others. I wanted to earn my place at the table by giving back into the community that had plucked me out of my despair.</p>\n<h3>Time to merge</h3>\n<p>Iâ€™d done a podcast episode with Michelle Ames and I noticed she worked for the plugin, GiveWP. Out of curiosity, I wandered over to their careers page and saw an opening for a support tech. I had the job within 3 days.</p>\n<p>Iâ€™ve done a lot of things out of fear that many people find brave. I was told I was brave for majoring in theater, but Iâ€™d done it because I didnâ€™t want to fail at something unfamiliar. I was told I was brave for moving to Los Angeles after I dropped out, but I was afraid to be stagnant. I was told I was brave to start my own business, but I was afraid to work for someone else.</p>\n<p>I do feel fear. Fear that I donâ€™t know enough, that Iâ€™m too young or inexperienced, that Iâ€™ll let down the people who have cheered me on, that Iâ€™ll end up vulnerable the way I was in my last job. That Iâ€™ll get hurt. That being a black, queer, woman in the tech space will be too challenging.</p>\n<p>Iâ€™m comforted by the knowledge that most WordPress people donâ€™t care what gender/color/sexuality you areâ€¦ as long as you keep your plugins updated. Open-source means youâ€™re not here to out-do the next person, but to contribute toward a common goal. I can dive into support at Give with WordPress as my base, my constant. I can finally acknowledge that I am worth being part of a team. It means all the difference in the world.</p>\n<h3>Who invented this path nonsense anyway?</h3>\n<p>I donâ€™t have to be on a path anymore. I can let myself remain open to possibilities and say â€œyesâ€ more. I donâ€™t have to decide what Iâ€™m going to be, <i>I can just become it,</i> because I can trust myself and the foundation that WordPress has given me. WordPress, with itâ€™s limitless contributors, versions, and possibilities, reminds us that we should be excited by change, not afraid.</p>\n<p>I believe that giving up what I worked for 3 years to build is the bravest thing Iâ€™ve done so far. At first, I was furious at myself that I couldnâ€™t make my own business as sustainable as Iâ€™d wanted. Moving to Give felt like failing. But Louise called it â€œfailing upâ€ which I think is pretty apt. It was a step forward into something I could grow into and really succeed at, rather than sticking with the familiar like I had always done.</p>\n<p>I often remind myself of a quote from Buffy the Vampire Slayer which, ironically, I watched for the first time while in some the deepest throes of my depression: <i>â€œ</i><i>I&#8217;m cookie dough. I&#8217;m not done baking.

Although the plugin hasn&#8217;t officially launched yet, a <a href=\"https://msgwp.com/demo/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">live demo</a> on the website allows people to anonymously publish a post to msgWP&#8217;s demo blog from their own Telegram accounts by launching a Telegram bot.</p>\n<p>The plugin&#8217;s creator, <a href=\"https://github.com/meszarosrob\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">RÃ³bert MÃ©szÃ¡ros</a>, said he plans to launch it in late summer or early fall, after collecting more feedback from beta testers and polishing the website. MÃ©szÃ¡ros is a developer who mainly works on a contract or freelance basis. Although msgWP isn&#8217;t is first WordPress plugin, it is the first one he has created as a product to promote.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s highly unlikely that I&#8217;ll make msgWP available on the WordPress.org Plugin Directory, but it&#8217;s going to be GPL licensed,&#8221; MÃ©szÃ¡ros said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Support, automatic updates, and restricted content will be available only for those who buy a plan. Since I&#8217;m using msgWP myself and I plan to donate a part of profit back to the community, to the WordPress Foundation.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Most of the plugins available that integrate Telegram with WordPress either broadcast to a channel or display the feed of a public channel in a widget. This is the first plugin that sends Telegram user-generated content into WordPress.</p>\n<p>I tested the demo last night and successfully posted a text to the demo blog. Images do not yet appear to be working on the demo or may be disabled for now. MÃ©szÃ¡ros said the demo implementation unhooks some of the checks that are enabled by default on the plugin.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-02-at-12.36.31-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>When the msgWP plugin is used on a site, administrators need to allow a Telegram account to create posts explicitly. This setting is available in the admin screen where you can enter the username of a Telegram account. Adding multiple usernames to the whitelist opens up some interesting possibilities for group blogging.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Since every Telegram message contains information about the Telegram account, we can filter out those who are not whitelisted,&#8221; MÃ©szÃ¡ros said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Also, the fact that users are explicitly whitelisted opens up the way to have user level settings. For example, you can set a specific category for a Telegram account or only give them the option to create draft posts.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If you whitelist yourself you have a microblog; if you whitelist 20 users with various settings, you can cover a live event with Telegram and msgWP.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The msgWP plugin also checks the IP of the request. If it falls outside a particular IP range, msgWP can recognize that it&#8217;s not from Telegram and block it.</p>\n<p>MÃ©szÃ¡ros&#8217; inspiration for the plugin came from his principles regarding centralized social media. While he maintains a private blog where his friends follow him, MÃ©szÃ¡ros&#8217; doesn&#8217;t use platforms like Twitter and Facebook.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I feel strongly about blogging and microblogging,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Itâ€™s not all rainbows â€“ if you have one, you know that it takes a certain kind of commitment and effort.&#8221;</p>\n<p>MÃ©szÃ¡ros said he was also inspired &#8220;by an almost forgotten history of WordPress,&#8221; wherein many took advantage of its support for XML-RPC to blog from desktop blog editors, like MarsEdit, BlogJet, and BlogDesk, without ever logging into the admin. He contends that third-party tools like this demonstrate that <a href=\"https://msgwp.com/what-is-wordpress-without-its-editor-we-are-not-sure/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress is more than the editor</a>.</p>\n<p>Since msgWP is already integrated into the messaging workflow for Telegram users, it may inspire some to blog more often. Posting is faster than using Twitter, Facebook, or even the WordPress mobile apps, albeit with far fewer features.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Paradoxically we want to encourage people to use WordPress by not reminding them that they run their sites/microblogs on WordPress,&#8221; MÃ©szÃ¡ros said. &#8220;A messaging app has some informality to it, and that will help a lot. All you need is to write and press send. After all, you are sending texts, and not publishing structured articles on your blog after too many glasses of wine. For this reason, we don&#8217;t see msgWP with Telegram as a replacement for the WP Mobile Apps.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Despite the convenience promised through various apps, the concept of microblogging on one&#8217;s own website does not seem to have taken off yet. Services like <a href=\"https://micro.blog/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">micro.blog</a>, which integrate with existing WordPress blogs, are still used by a fervent few and have not yet gained mainstream adoption. Even the â€œPress Thisâ€ feature that was included in WordPress core prior to 2017, was <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/press-this-removed-from-wordpress-4-9-in-favor-of-a-plugin\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">retired in favor of a canonical plugin</a>, with discontinued support for the bookmarklet feature. It hasn&#8217;t been updated for two years and is only installed on approximately 10,000 sites.</p>\n<p>Postcard, a social sharing and microblogging app that integrated with WordPress, is another tool that was aimed at fundamentally changing how people use social networks. It was <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/postcard-project-discontinued-ios-and-android-apps-now-open-source\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">discontinued due to the development burden</a> of supporting multiple apps.</p>\n<p>There are many different solutions that have popped up over the years for enabling quick posts or microblogging, all with vastly different approaches. msgWP has an advantage in that MÃ©szÃ¡ros can leverage the power and speed of Telegram, along with all of its mobile and desktop clients, without having to maintain that aspect of the publishing interface. Even if it doesn&#8217;t spark a wildfire of microblogging across the web, it may offer users a convenient alternative to posting content inside social media silos, especially for niche use cases like group microblogging for live events.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 02 Jul 2019 22:36:12 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"Matt: Just Write with David Perrell\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=49754\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:52:\"https://ma.tt/2019/07/just-write-with-david-perrell/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:595:\"<p>I had an <a href=\"https://www.perell.com/podcast/matt-mulleweg\">interesting conversation with David Perrell on his North Star Podcast that I recommend checking out</a>.

The 28-minute video explores how quickly the project began to have an impact on the wider tech industry after Facebook publicly released it as an open source project.</p>\n<p>GraphQL co-founder Nick Schrock, who was interviewed along with fellow co-creators Lee Byron and Dan Schafer, said the documentary &#8220;captured both the urgency and joy of the early months of the GraphQL.&#8221; It was filmed over two months in San Francisco and Berlin, where Honeypot runs the <a href=\"https://www.graphqlconf.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">GraphQL Conf</a> in cooperation with <a href=\"https://www.prisma.io/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Prisma</a>.</p>\n<p>GraphQL began as an internal project at Facebook that was born out of necessity as the tech industry began to shift towards providing better mobile experiences for users. At that time, Facebook&#8217;s native apps were just a thin wrapper around the mobile website.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The inability of a large technology company to adjust to a technology shift as big as the mobile shift is the type of thing that will consign a seemingly unstoppable empire to the grave in a matter of a few years,&#8221; Schrock said.</p>\n<p>Facebook decided to re-write the Facebook iOS app but the APIs they had at that time were inadequate for creating the Newsfeed. A new Newsfeed API was written simultaneously to be used with the new mobile app. Facebook for iOS 5.0, released in 2012, was a native re-write of the app and also the first time GraphQL was deployed in the wild. Following that release, its use was expanded beyond just the Newsfeed to encompass most of the functionality offered in Facebook&#8217;s iOS app.</p>\n<p>Facebook shared GraphQL with the world at React Europe 2015 and published the GraphQL spec later in 2015. They explained that their goal was to design what they thought was the ideal API for frontend developers and work backwards with the technology.</p>\n<p>GraphQL&#8217;s creators were surprised at how fast the uptake was after making the project public. Engineers at Airbnb, Twitter, and Github were early adopters and their experiences are shared in the documentary with interviews from the community. The problems GraphQL&#8217;s creators encountered in scaling their mobile experience were not specific to Facebook. Other companies had similar problems and the demand for GraphQL in the industry was already there. Within six months, the team saw implementations of GraphQL in many of the major programming languages. They realized how important the project was to the industry after <a href=\"https://github.blog/2016-09-14-the-github-graphql-api/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub announced in 2016 that its public API would be a GraphQL API</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Using GraphQL on the frontend and backend eliminates the gap between what we release and what you can consume. We really look forward to making more of these simultaneous releases. GraphQL represents a massive leap forward for API development. Type safety, introspection, generated documentation, and predictable responses benefit both the maintainers and consumers of our platform.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The documentary tells the story of how GraphQL began the first three years as a solution to internal problems at Facebook but expanded to become a community tool that was initially adopted by hobbyists and then incorporated into the products of large tech companies. GraphQL co-founder Lee Byron predicts that the project is entering the next phase of its life and &#8220;heading towards becoming an industry standard and one that&#8217;s collaborative.&#8221;</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s no way to measure the number of APIs that are being built around GraphQL, but the query language is now used  in both internal and external APIs at major companies like Pinterest, Intuit, Coursera, Walmart, Shopify, PayPal, KLM, NBC News Digital, Credit Karma, Wayfair, and Yelp. Since it can be used in combination with REST APIs, GraphQL&#8217;s rapid adoption is not necessarily a good predictor for the end of REST architecture, but it&#8217;s a trend that is worth following. This widespread adoption began with just a handful of engineers who saw GraphQL&#8217;s promise at React Europe 2015, built tools to optimize development, and advocated for using GraphQL at their companies.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I totally underestimated the power of these open source communities,&#8221; Schrock said. &#8220;We had to rely on this community of poeple to form spontaneously and then build implementations of this in different languages and then actually productionize it and build an entire tool ecosystem around it. I didn&#8217;t think that was ever going to work, and I was totally wrong. If an idea makes sense to people and it clicks with their mind and they can see the vision, they are actually willing to do a lot of work in order to see it executed and share their work, and it&#8217;s a pretty remarkable thing to see.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The energy in the GraphQL documentary is inspiring and the story shares many parallels with other open source projects that have gained widespread adoption through passionate communities.

Jenny&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7D5p25NyAk\">interview</a> with <strong>Torque</strong> at WCEU is worth a listen too. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f31e.png\" alt=\"ðŸŒž\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></li><li><strong>John Jacoby</strong>â€™s talk on â€œ<a href=\"https://2019.europe.wordcamp.org/session/advanced-database-management-for-plugins/\">Advanced Database Management For Plugins</a>â€ explored the pain of dealing with databases when you&#8217;re writing plugins. He also announced a stand-alone open source library for better WordPress database management that will be released in July.</li><li><strong>Josepha Haden</strong>&#8216;s talk entitled â€œ<a href=\"https://2019.europe.wordcamp.org/session/change-your-socks-change-your-mind-a-no-fuss-primer-on-change-management/\">Change your socks, change your mind: A no-fuss primer on change management</a>â€ focused on the things group and community leaders should attend to most during periods of significant change. That&#8217;s a timely subject, given the events of the past year, and Josepha&#8217;s points apply to many parts of the WordPress community. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11.2.0/72x72/1f9e6.png\" alt=\"ðŸ§¦\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Mattâ€™s talk after lunch on Friday was more of an update on Gutenberg. Matt presented some Gutenberg stats and then put the spotlight on some new block editor plugins and experiments. Matt reminded everyone that Gutenberg is in phase two, â€œwhere we are working with widgets (old school blocks), customization, and menus.â€</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Matt&#8217;s Session</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Matt showed off the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/grids/\"><strong>Grid</strong> block plugin</a> from <strong>Evolve</strong> that generates any layout style with a slick UI. You have to see it in action.</li><li>Gutenberg is now <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/gutenberg\">available for <strong>Drupal</strong></a><strong>.</strong></li><li>There are about 150k posts published each day with Gutenberg. That&#8217;s about two every second, and ta rate is increasing.</li><li>Gutenberg will soon have:<ul><li>A block directory that&#8217;s accessible from the â€œtop-level navigationâ€ on the .org site.</li><li>Footnotes and improved â€œmicroâ€ animations.</li><li>Special attention placed on the mobile experience. Matt noted that &#8220;Gutenberg for mobile is live, and the ability [to use its features] is increased now in the mobile apps.&#8221; He also mentioned they &#8220;had to write the codebase separately for this experience.&#8221;</li></ul></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The initial questions Matt got from the audience were somewhat aggressive and prolonged, so the moderators found it a challenge to keep things moving. At one point, a moderator broke in to say, â€œThis isnâ€™t a question; itâ€™s a blog post.â€ Iâ€™m wondering if in the future at WCEU (or the upcoming WordCamp US) if a different moderation process might be considered.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I had to choose one question of note, it would be the one asked about Matt&#8217;s (and WordPressâ€™s) commitment to accessibility. Matt replied, â€œAccessibility is hard. We will get there. I believe we can make every release of WordPress better, but itâ€™s challenging with Gutenberg because there might not be previous examples to work from.â€ He acknowledged the excellent work that <strong>WPCampus</strong> recently did with its accessibility audit.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Saturday Highlights:</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Saturdayâ€™s talks, like Fridayâ€™s, were well done, although the panel on Gutenberg might have had more diversity in its composition, as a few people noted on Twitter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two especially notable talks:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Brian Teeman</strong>, one of the Joomla co-founders, defined what counts as truly free software. (<a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/brianteeman/the-power-of-free-151309934\">Slides</a>) If you have begun to wonder how cloud services and <strong>Jetpack</strong> challenge the concept of &#8220;free,&#8221; check out Brian&#8217;s talk. Brian also has a recent post on his blog with <a href=\"https://brian.teeman.net/web/891-learn-something-new-at-a-conference\">some good advice for conference goers</a>: attend sessions randomly or pick ones with unfamiliar topics if you want to learn the most.</li><li><strong>Marcel Bootsman</strong> gave an inspiring account of his 700km walk to Berlin to attend the conference. It tied in well with <strong>Ines Van Essen</strong>â€™s talk later that afternoon about bringing peop<a href=\"https://2019.europe.wordcamp.org/session/bringing-people-to-wordcamps/\">https://2019.europe.wordcamp.org/session/bringing-people-to-wordcamps/</a>le to WordCamps and how much it typically costs for someone to attend.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The conclusion of WCEU came with the usual display of conference statistics:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>3,260 tickets were sold.

This is a feature that has traditionally been handled by plugins, which has resulted in many different implementations across different sites. It also means that many sites do not have XML sitemaps, which can be a problem because they are hugely important to having your site correctly indexed by search engines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The proposal details how core sitemaps would be structured and how the team would build them, as well as what aspects of WordPress would not be considered appropriate information to be included.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to get involved in building this feature?

Two new packages have been created that require code review and testing. The first is an Autoload Package, a foundational package for theme developers who are not currently using Composer (although <a href=\"https://getcomposer.org/\">Composer</a> is recommended instead of this package). The second is a Customizer Section Button Package that allows theme authors to create a link/button to any URL.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are other proposed ideas for packages that require feedback and additional discussion.

This year the event will feature one track devoted to exploring topics surrounding &#8220;headless WordPress,&#8221; an approach that eschews WordPress&#8217; traditional architecture in favor of decoupling the front and backends, allowing developers to integrate different stacks. The track includes presentations like A React Theme in 30 Min, SEO for Headless WordPress Themes, Gatsby &amp; WordPress, and Headless E-Commerce with BigCommerce. Other tracks feature more general JavaScript and Gutenberg topics.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/js-for-wp-conf-schedule-2019.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Thanks to more than a dozen sponsors, registration is free, but viewers must <a href=\"https://javascriptforwp.com/conference/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">sign up</a> on the conference website in order to attend online.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 29 Jun 2019 00:16:18 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:44:\"WPTavern: In Case You Missed It â€“ Issue 27\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:59:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=91256&preview=true&preview_id=91256\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"https://wptavern.com/in-case-you-missed-it-issue-27\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8950:\"<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ICYMIFeaturedImage.png?ssl=1\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-50955\"><img /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/112901923@N07/16153818039\">Night Moves</a> &#8211; <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/\">(license)</a></p>\n<p>Thereâ€™s a lot of great WordPress content published in the community but not all of it is featured on the Tavern. This post is an assortment of items related to WordPress that caught my eye but didnâ€™t make it into a full post.</p>\n<h2 class=\"entry-title\">Carol Gann Awarded the 2019 Kim Parsell Memorial Scholarship</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://carolgann.wordpress.com/\">Carol Gann</a>, who is a Meetup coordinator in the <a href=\"https://wporlando.org/\">WordPress Orlando Community</a>, has been awarded the <a href=\"https://2019.us.wordcamp.org/2019/06/28/carol-gann-2019-kim-parsell-memorial-scholarship-recipient/\">Kim Parsell Memorial Scholarship</a>. The scholarship is named after Kim Parsell who <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/kim-parsell-affectionately-known-as-wpmom-passes-away\">passed away in 2015</a> but her impact on the WordPress community is still felt today.</p>\n<p>&#8220;My proudest contribution to the WordPress open source project is training small business owners and bloggers to be comfortable and conversant with their own WordPress websites. WordPress empowers people. Many end users of WordPress are not technically minded. As a WordPress Meetup co-organizer, I contribute to the coffee help desk, assisting others in finding solutions to their WordPress problems. I also host another help desk opportunity, â€˜Coffee With Carol,â€™ to empower WordPress users,&#8221; Gann said.</p>\n<p>I can tell from the quote above that Kim and Carol would get along well as Kim was also the type of person who would do what she could to help others.</p>\n<h2>GravityView Diversity Grant to Attend PressNomics 6</h2>\n<p>The folks over at GravityView are <a href=\"https://gravityview.co/gravityview-diversity-grant/\">offering a grant</a> to recognize the challenges certain groups of people face succeeding in technology fields and to promote inclusivity and diversity. The grant includes a ticket to PressNomics 6, a flight to Tuscon, AZ, lodging, transportation via a Lyft gift card, and a one-on-one business consultation with Zak Katz, Co-founder of GravityView. The deadline to apply is 11:59 PM MDT on June 30, 2019.</p>\n<h2>10up OpenSource Project Scaffolding Suite</h2>\n<p>10up has released a <a href=\"https://10up.com/blog/2019/project-scaffolds-released/\">project scaffolding suite</a> that includes a WordPress starter theme, starter plugin, and NPM package. The purpose of the suite is to streamline repetitive tasks, encourage community contributions, and provide a starting point that includes 10up&#8217;s engineering best practices.</p>\n<h2>End to End Tests Added to Core</h2>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\"><p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/06/27/introducing-the-wordpress-e2e-tests/\">Introducing the WordPress e2e tests</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h2>WP Tavern Turns 10 Years Old</h2>\n<p>I was looking back through the Tavern archives and realized that this past January, WP Tavern turned 10 years old. It&#8217;s been quite a journey and it&#8217;s not over yet. Check out the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/welcome-to-the-wordpress-tavern\">first post</a> I published on the Tavern announcing its opening.</p>\n<h2>Matt Mullenweg Announces That Automattic Is Sponsoring Jill Binder&#8217;s Work</h2>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\"><p><a href=\"https://ma.tt/2019/06/diversifying-wordpress/\">Diversifying&nbsp;WordPress</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h2>John James Jacoby Releases A Plugin That Cryptographically Signs Posts</h2>\n<p>John James Jacoby <a href=\"https://jjj.blog/2019/06/heidenberg/\">has released</a> a <a href=\"https://github.com/JJJ/Heidenberg\">small plugin on GitHub</a> that cryptographically signs posts. The plugin splits the content of posts in words and then stenographically inserts zero-width characters between them. These characters then form a unique, invisible pattern that can be used to detect plagiarised content. This plugin sounds like it would pair well with <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/new-wordproof-plugin-timestamps-wordpress-content-on-the-blockchain\">WordProof</a>.</p>\n<h2>What does DXP Mean?</h2>\n<p>I asked on Twitter what does DXP or Digital Xperience platform mean?

Contributors plan to merge the API with 14 endpoints for popular components like activity updates, groups, members, private messages, and extended profile fields. Another eight endpoints for blogs, friends, and other features, are planned to ship in BuddyPress 6.0.0.</p>\n<p>The first major use of the BP REST API inside BuddyPress is a <a href=\"https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/12405\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">new group management interface</a> that enables administrators to quickly search for specific members to promote, demote, ban, or remove. BuddyPress contributor Mathieu Viet shared a demo of what users can expect from the new interface on both the frontend and the backend.</p>\n<p><div class=\"wp-video\"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement(\'video\');</script><![endif]-->\n<a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/5zJCxp2ARb.mp4\">https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/5zJCxp2ARb.mp4</a></div></p>\n<p>Contributors are still discussing how to include the BP REST API into the BuddyPress plugin package, whether they should continue maintaining it on GitHub until all the endpoints are finished and include it during the BuddyPress pluginâ€™s build process, or merge it into BuddyPress core and use Trac. GitHub is more convenient for development but some expressed concerns about fragmenting the history of the API&#8217;s development on two platforms.</p>\n<p>BuddyPress lead developer Boone Gorges said in a recent dev chat that shipping the BP REST API without documentation is a blocker. Contributors are now working on a new documentation site. Since version 5.0.0 will be more of a developer-oriented release, Viet suggested contributors take the opportunity to set up developer.buddypress.org with similar resources as WordPress has on its <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">DevHub</a> project. He is looking for feedback on his <a href=\"https://bpdevel.wordpress.com/2019/06/24/bp-devhub/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">proposal</a> for automatically generating the documents from the REST schemas of the API&#8217;s endpoints and further customizing it for integration into the broader developer.buddypress.org site.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/bp-rest-api-reference.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>BuddyPress contributors are targeting August 15 for releasing 5.0.0 beta 1 and will discuss a date for RC further down the road.

The User Interface as well as the backend that powers stats has been revamped and more closely resembles what you see on the Jetpack Stats module. There are now date selectors and individual stats contain more detail. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/img_2783.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a>Revamped Stats in the WordPress for iOS App</div>\n\n\n\n<p>More often than not over the years, when I&#8217;ve tried to view stats, they don&#8217;t load. In 12.6.1, the stats are cached making them not only quicker to load, but they&#8217;re available to view offline as well. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This version also improves the block editor by fixing an issue where the setting to open links in new tabs was always set to off. Also, when users attempt to put invalid content into blocks, there&#8217;s a more descriptive error message. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those who share photos into WordPress from other apps can now share an unlimited number of photos and if an image fails to upload, the error message will contain more detailed information. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WordPress for iOS app uses libraries from third-party&#8217;s. To see who these parties are, the team has added an acknowledgments section in the app. You can view this page by browsing to Me &gt; App Settings &gt; About WordPress for iOS &gt; Acknowledgements. Fair warning, this page is quite lengthy. There&#8217;s also a variety of bug fixes in this version as well. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/img_2784.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a>WordPress for iOS Third-party Library Acknowledgements </div>\n\n\n\n<p>One change that I noticed that doesn&#8217;t make sense and that I&#8217;ve been unable to find an explanation for is the labeling change. The app is now labeled on the app store as <strong>WordPress #1 Website Builder</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t view the app as a website builder, it&#8217;s more of a website manager. I&#8217;ve asked in the WordPress Mobile Slack channel why this change was made <s>but as of publishing, have not received a response</s>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress for iOS is free and <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wordpress-1-website-builder/id335703880\">available on iTunes</a>. There&#8217;s also a mobile app for Android devices and a desktop application that be found on the <a href=\"https://apps.wordpress.com/mobile/\">WordPress Mobile Apps</a> site. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Updated June 28th, 2019</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I received a response from Elisa Budelli, Mobile Developer at Automattic, regarding the label change. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The title is describing WordPress as a full product, not only the mobile apps. The switch is based on a recommendation from a SEO specialist, and we will evaluate how it works and revert if we see no impact.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 27 Jun 2019 23:48:11 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:89:\"WPTavern: EditorsKit 1.6 and 1.7 Add Tools for Writers, Drag and Drop Block Export/Import\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=90711\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:99:\"https://wptavern.com/editorskit-1-6-and-1-7-add-tools-for-writers-drag-and-drop-block-export-import\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4444:\"<p>Recent <a href=\"https://editorskit.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">EditorsKit</a> releases have introduced a set of new tools that some writers may have found missing from Gutenberg. The plugin&#8217;s creator, Jeffrey Carandang, said <a href=\"https://jeffreycarandang.com/editorskit-1-6/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">version 1.6</a> was targeted at improving the writing flow for writers, bloggers, and content creators.</p>\n<p>Gutenberg has decent support for copying and pasting Markdown. It will automatically convert links, blockquotes, code snippets, and other formatting into the proper Gutenberg blocks. However, the editor does not offer full support for users who who want to write with Markdown.</p>\n<p>EditorsKit 1.6 adds basic markdown capabilities for things like <em>bold</em>, <em>italic</em> and ~strikethrough~ and these can also be used alongside other available editor markdowns and their keyboard shortcuts. These are integrated directly into the RichText editor so you don&#8217;t have to use a dedicated Markdown plugin with a custom block, like <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-githuber-md/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WP Githuber MD</a>, or <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/support/markdown/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Jetpack&#8217;s Markdown module</a>.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">EditorsKit 1.6  is now available <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f680.png\" alt=\"ðŸš€\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Comes with Gutenberg Editor Markdown Support, Clear Formatting, Subscript &amp; Superscript Formats, Toggle Title and more. Here\'s a quick preview on how these features were integrated on WordPress Gutenberg block editor <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f3ac.png\" alt=\"ðŸŽ¬\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> <a href=\"https://t.co/apB4uMjuqg\">pic.twitter.com/apB4uMjuqg</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Jeffrey Carandang (@phpbits) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/phpbits/status/1135895882216329216?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 4, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Version 1.6 introduced an expanded &#8220;clear formatting&#8221; option as a response to requests Carandang received on the plugin&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/1306393256173179/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook community</a> and Slack. It clears formatting on specific text, removes formatting on selected text, and clears all paragraph and heading block formatting using the â€œClear Block Formattingâ€ option in the block settings. This version also added subscript, superscript, and uppercase text formats, along with a title visibility toggle that removes titles from the frontend on a per-post basis.</p>\n<p>While these tools may provide features that some users find to be critically missing from Gutenberg, for many others they simply add to the clutter of the block toolbar and the overall interface. Gutenberg is still sorely in need of a distraction-free UI that will enable users to ditch dedicated writing apps and embrace WordPress as their go-to app for writing.</p>\n<p>EditorsKit seems best suited as a playground for features that may or may not have widespread appeal. For example, the most recent <a href=\"https://jeffreycarandang.com/editorskit-1-7/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">1.7 release</a> enables exporting and importing blocks without the requirement of first converting them to reusable blocks. Users can click on the â€œblock settingsâ€ icon and export as JSON on a per-block basis. It&#8217;s also possible to select multiple blocks and export them in one file.</p>\n<p>Importing blocks back into the editor is as easy as dragging and dropping the .json file. It automatically generates the blocks in an almost magical way an does not require users to navigate to the separate admin dashboard for managing reusable blocks.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cloudup.com/cLTgwKHjATO\"><img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/cldup.com/WTnhlb_CI9.gif?resize=627%2C353&ssl=1\" alt=\"Import json\" width=\"627\" height=\"353\" /></a></p>\n<p>Carandang is working on making the import/export work with media attachments. He is also currently working with the Gutenberg team and other contributors to bring the plugin&#8217;s <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/16014\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Text and Highlight colors feature</a> to the core editor.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 27 Jun 2019 22:55:54 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:16;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:80:\"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 358 â€“ Interview with Dan Maby, Founder of WP&amp;UP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:59:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=91203&preview=true&preview_id=91203\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-358-interview-with-dan-maby-founder-of-wpup\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2475:\"<p>In this episode, <a href=\"https://www.presstitan.com/\">Malcolm Peralty</a> and I are joined by Dan Maby, Founder of WP&amp;UP. <a href=\"https://wpandup.org/\">WP&amp;UP</a> is a non-profit charity based in England that supports and promotes positive mental health in the WordPress Community.</p>\n<p>Dan explains why he started the charity, what he&#8217;s learned and how he manages his own mental health, and how the donation funds are spent.

This week, the team has released two feature packages that illustrate what the project is trying to accomplish. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first is an <a href=\"https://github.com/WPTRT/autoload\">Autoloader</a> that provides the means necessary for theme authors to autoload PHP classes. While <a href=\"https://getcomposer.org/\">Composer</a> is recommended, the team has created a PSR-4 compliant autoloader as an alternative for those not ready for Composer. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This is a foundational package that will allow you to use any other  packages that we create,&#8221; Tadlock explained.  &#8220;You could even use it for autoloading your own  theme classes if you choose to do so (assuming they follow the <a href=\"https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/\">PSR-4 autoloading standard</a> for class and folder names).&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second package provides a <a href=\"https://github.com/WPTRT/customize-section-button\">Customizer Section Button</a> that enables theme authors to create a link or button that points to a URL. This feature was originally developed to allow developers a standard way to display a Pro/Upsell link within the customizer. However, the package is generic enough that developers can use it to link to any URL. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tadlock also provided feedback on a number of ideas that were proposed. Packages up for consideration include, Breadcrumbs, Sliders and Sections, Mobile Navigation, Color Control with Transparency, Appearance > Theme Name Page, and Standard Template Hooks. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To read his feedback and learn more about the project, including how to get involved, read the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2019/06/24/feature-packages-update/\">feature package update</a> and the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2019/06/07/proposal-theme-feature-repositories/\">initial proposal</a>. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 27 Jun 2019 01:01:53 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:59:\"WPTavern: Gutenberg 6.0 Adds Layout Picker to Columns Block\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=91159\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-6-0-adds-layout-picker-to-columns-block\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2325:\"<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/06/26/whats-new-in-gutenberg-26th-june/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenberg 6.0</a> was released today with a major update to the Columns block. Users can now select from a set of pre-defined layouts for their columns, with additional features that address many long-standing complaints regarding the block&#8217;s usability.</p>\n<p>Although many plugins are already doing more advanced things with columns and grid layouts, WordPress core&#8217;s current implementation of the Columns block is so confusing that it is barely usable. It has a sliding control for selecting the number of columns but it is difficult to see the column boundaries. </p>\n<p>Gutenberg 6.0 gives users the ability to select from multiple pre-defined column options, which include some commonly-requested layouts with variable widths. Users can also elect to skip the layouts and start from scratch. Below is a video demo Gutenberg phase 2 lead Riad Benguella shared in the release post:</p>\n<p><div class=\"wp-video\"><a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/12-columns.mp4\">https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/12-columns.mp4</a></div></p>\n<p>The column settings also include a sliding percentage width control, so users can further customize it, whether starting from a template or from scratch.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screen-Shot-2019-06-26-at-1.07.16-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>In adding pre-defined layouts to columns, the Gutenberg team <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/16129\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">enhanced the InnerBlocks component</a>, allowing developers to extend it to create their own sets of template options to appear upon inserting a block. The Columns block serves as an example implementation of this.</p>\n<p>This release also incorporates more than a dozen smaller enhancements and fixes, including <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/16020\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">snackbar notice support for the widgets screen</a>.

The data includes responses from more than 11,000 developers in 135 countries. Respondents identified themselves as male (84.71%), female (9.9%), non-binary/third gender (0.86%), and &#8220;prefer not to say&#8221; (2.62%).</p>\n<p>Sacha Greif and RaphaÃ«l Benitte, creators of the survey, said it&#8217;s skewed towards early adopters, since the sample size is a fairly small selection of the overall CSS developer community. Greif and Benitte also created the State of JS survey, which is where 31.5% of respondents heard about the CSS survey, so the data is also slanted towards the â€œback of the front-end,â€ developers who use JavaScript in their front-end work. They concluded that this data is a good preview of where the mainstream side of the ecosystem will be a few years from now. </p>\n<p>The majority of respondents indicated that they are fairly confident about their <a href=\"https://2019.stateofcss.com/demographics/backend-proficiency\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">back-end proficiency</a>, with 62.49% identifying themselves as possessing intermediate or advanced backend skills. This trend sets the bar higher for developers who are looking to present a competitive skill-set in the CSS workforce.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screen-Shot-2019-06-21-at-5.10.10-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The results seem clearly bent towards the JavaScript-proficient segment of CSS developers, with a whopping 80.54% rating their <a href=\"https://2019.stateofcss.com/demographics/javascript-proficiency\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">JavaScript proficiency</a> at Intermediate to Expert level.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screen-Shot-2019-06-25-at-8.24.13-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The summary includes a highly detailed look at different CSS-related technologies, such as preprocessors, methodologies, frameworks, and CSS-in-JS, with differently colored segments representing whether developers have favorable or negative opinions on each. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screen-Shot-2019-06-25-at-8.33.12-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a> </p>\n<p>The results contain data visualizations showing which CSS features and technologies developers know about and/or have used in their work. Flexbox (94.4%) and Grid (54.4%) are among the most widely used layout tools. The frameworks section revealed some surprising results, with a few of the lesser-known frameworks, like Tailwind, Bulma, PureCSS, and Tachyon ranking highest in interest and satisfaction. The most well-known frameworks, Bootstrap and Foundation, fall at the bottom of the satisfaction scale.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screen-Shot-2019-06-25-at-8.43.58-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>These results are fairly representative of early adopters of new technologies in the CSS ecosystem, covering features and frameworks that are not yet mainstream.

If you donâ€™t stretch it, it will shrink.</h3>\n<p>It still feels unreal. Two days ago, I was standing on a stage, sharing my expertise. And not just any stage. One of the stages of WordCamp Europe 2019 in Berlin. A conference with over 3200 registrants, over 2700 attendees. A conference room with a capacity of 1100, 60-70% full. And lots of positive feedback.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/yvette-sonneveld-wceu.jpg\"><img /></a></p>\n<h3>Never judge by appearances</h3>\n<p>Getting to this point hasnâ€™t been a walk in the park. Not even remotely. Had you asked me about something like this five years ago, I would have smirked. Statistically, I am much more likely to be depressed, chronically anxious or abusing substances. You see, I have been a victim of <a href=\"https://www.medicinenet.com/bullying/article.htm#what_are_the_effects_of_bullying_what_are_the_effects_of_hazing\">(relational) bullying</a> several times during my elementary school years. I changed schools because of it, yet it happened again.</p>\n<p>Bear with me here, this is not going to be a â€œI feel so sorry for myselfâ€ sob story. There is lots of hope, encouragement and empowerment in this story. Yes, I have struggled with feelings of insecurity and feelings of â€œnot being worthwhileâ€. And yes, every time I think I have finally dealt with it, it does pop up again in another shape or form. But every single time, I have been able to turn it around into an opportunity to grow. I may still depend a bit more on validation than average. But people who know me, will confirm that I am known to be one to encourage others.</p>\n<h3>A little bit of context</h3>\n<p>I wonâ€™t wear you out with the whole back story. Instead, let me take you back about 5 years. Me, my husband, and my two kids had been living in the Caribbean for a number of years. Unfortunately, I had hit another rough patch. I had been working with a wonderful local psychologist, but I was not getting the results I hoped for. And then it hit me: I would not be growing without intentionally seeking out opportunities to grow. So I decided to send myself out on an experiment. And, thankfully we were able to afford an experiment like that.</p>\n<h3>Being intentional about personal development</h3>\n<p>One of the goals I set, was to be able to present myself as a digital marketing expert more comfortably. And I felt that it would be easier to do this outside my local area since I was running a pattern of playing small there. So I purchased a ticket to WordCamp Miami (a short flight away). As I started to freak out about what I had done, an email came in. The organization was looking for volunteers. Perfect timing. That would help me focus on helping others rather than feeling lost and not knowing whom to talk to. Or getting all hyper from butterflying around.</p>\n<p>This turned out to be a great decision. I had never encountered a community more inviting and inclusive. I had a blast during the weekend. And even got invited over for a home-cooked dinner by one of my co-volunteers. Some first lasting friendships were born that weekend.</p>\n<p>Having this first volunteer experience under my belt landed me several volunteer gigs in the US over the following years. Not only for WordCamps, but also for a much more expensive internet marketing conferences and coaching programs.</p>\n<a href=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mynams-2015.jpg\"><img /></a>One of the events I got to volunteer at, was MyNAMS 2015. I was first timer, volunteer and (assistant) trainer at the same time.\n<h3>Starting all over again</h3>\n<p>Then, three years ago, we moved back to The Netherlands, and I had no professional network in my home country at all. So, once our family had found a new routine, I signed up as a volunteer for WordCamp Europe in Paris (2017). That made me stretch far out of my comfort zone since about 2000 people would attend, and I did not know one single soul. Signing up as a volunteer was a no-brainer already by that time. To help myself get over some anxiety about the number of people attending, I decided to sign up for contributors day for the first time. After all, â€œonlyâ€ some 300 people would attend that event.</p>\n<p>The friendly people at the marketing team adopted me right away and gave me something useful to do. I teamed up with another volunteer to set up several Trello boards to manage the many ongoing projects. Over the weekend I got connected to more warm, welcoming and encouraging people than I could ever imagine. Some of them noticed that I had a way of expressing myself that could point to a talent for speaking. They kept encouraging me to the point that I submitted my very first talk proposal. Looking back, I never really expected to be picked. You should have seen my face when I received the e-mail stating I had been selected&#8230;</p>\n<h3>Another leap of faith</h3>\n<p>So two months later, I was standing in front of some 50 people. At WordCamp Nijmegen, I shared my story about growing my self-confidence to a much healthier level by volunteering during WordCamps and other events. You can view the recording on <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2017/10/14/yvette-sonneveld-voluntourism-how-being-a-wordcamp-volunteer-gets-you-places/\">WordPress.tv</a>. I received some great feedback. This gave me the confidence to apply for the next WordCamp, this time with a topic within my field of expertise: How to create buyer persona.</p>\n<p>Over the course of 2 years, one opportunity led to another: First, I became part of the organizing team of WordCamp Utrecht and helped organize that event twice. Then, I became a team rep for the #MakeWordPress marketing team. Next, I got to lead a workshop at WordCamp Europe 2018. And as a result of all of this, I landed several freelance gigs, training virtual assistants and writing copy for a renowned WordPress agency, Level Level. Ultimately, by making myself stretch my comfort zone a bit further out every single time, I ended up landing my dream job. Iâ€™m now in charge of marketing for Level Level.</p>\n<a href=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/WCEU2018.jpg\"><img /></a>Contributing to WordPress will help you make friends from all over the world. I warmly recommend it!\n<h3>Lessons learned along the way</h3>\n<p>Do I still have my moments of not feeling enough? Totally. But let me share some of the most valuable lessons I learned along the way.</p>\n<h4>People who were never bullied have the same insecurities</h4>\n<p>Ha, you didnâ€™t see that one coming, right? And until you are ever ready to open up about your feelings of insecurity, others will probably not feel safe sharing their feelings about it, either. Because being vulnerable IS scary. And people may abuse it. But it can be amazingly empowering, too. Blaming the bullying and staying in my ever-shrinking comfort zone would probably have been easier, but Iâ€™m so happy I ended up discovering that it turned out I was telling myself a lie.</p>\n<h4>Your comfort zone is a muscle. It is made to stretch.</h4>\n<p>This has become one of my pet peeves. Work your comfort zone like a muscle. If you donâ€™t, it will shrink right back. Youâ€™ll keep playing small. Stretching it will be painful at first. But imagine that feeling of victory, that intense satisfaction when you look back and notice how much you have grown. Needless to say, it takes quite a bit of energy. You will be exhausted at times, and your comfort zone muscles will be sore. Itâ€™s the circle of life, after all. You will survive and grow stronger every day, which is exactly what I want for you.</p>\n<h3>Find your kind of crazy</h3>\n<p>We WordPress people, as unique as we all are, have lots in common, too. When helping my son through a rough patch several years ago, I did a lot of online research. I took a deep dive into everything from ADD to giftedness, and from visual learning to being highly sensitive. The â€œsymptomsâ€ of all of these are very much alike. And the biggest lesson: if youâ€™re able to focus for a long time on something that you really enjoy, itâ€™s not ADD.Â  You may recognize some of these â€œsymptomsâ€:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>not being able to sit still;</li>\n<li>easily distracted when working on routine matters;</li>\n<li>being able to hyperfocus when working on something that intrigues you;</li>\n<li>having a wide variety of interests;</li>\n<li>tend to get into power struggles with authoritative personalities;</li>\n<li>highly creative;</li>\n<li>mastering new skills by understanding and applying a concept rather than mastering it step by step (Once you know the concept of addition in math, for instance, it doesnâ€™t matter whether you add 2+4 or 19574+274503. This in contrast to others who need to start with 1 digit numbers, then to 2 digit numbers etc).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(see, <a href=\"https://www.sengifted.org/post/adhd-and-children-who-are-gifted\">https://www.sengifted.org/post/adhd-and-children-who-are-gifted</a> and <a href=\"https://www.davidsongifted.org/Search-Database/entry/A10226\">https://www.davidsongifted.org/Search-Database/entry/A10226</a> if youâ€™d like to learn more about this.)</p>\n<p>Over the past two years, I had lots of conversations with community members, and have learned along the way that many recognize these. I think this is one of the reasons we feel so connected. But whether this sounds like you, or not at allâ€¦. I strongly recommend you to find and connect to a group of people that you resonate with and who love you for who YOU are. Encourage each other.</p>\n<h4>Be ruthless about self-care</h4>\n<p>I can see a huge difference in how I feel, both physically and mentally, depending on how well I take care of myself. Purely in simple things like eating lots of fruits and veggies. Drinking no-sugar drinks like herbal infusions and water. Getting enough sleep. Being out in nature. Exercising regularly. Hanging out with friends and family instead of working all the time. This by itself wonâ€™t get you out of a depression, but I am confident it will help improve things. It helps me from getting burned out, for sure.</p>\n<h3>If youâ€™re employing one of us</h3>\n<p>You may be reading this and leading a team of WordPress people. And you may, or may not recognize yourself in parts of my story. Either way, I may have some valuable tips for you, too.</p>\n<h4>Weâ€™re precious. Weâ€™re valuable. And, we need more validation than average</h4>\n<p>We may not always notice that weâ€™re burning the midnight oil. We may need you, or our co-workers to notice. Weâ€™re sprinters, not marathon runners. So weâ€™ll have bouts of brilliance, and bouts where nothing may seem to come out of our hands. Know that. Appreciate that. And help us know that itâ€™s ok that weâ€™re wired like that. We may need that wee bit more of validation, of encouragement. We need to know you believe in us and that weâ€™re valuable. And we may need a hug every once in a while.</p>\n<p>Disclaimer</p>\n<p>Iâ€™m not a psychologist. Iâ€™m just sharing what I what I learned while trying to turn my life around. Also, the highs and the lows keep coming and going. Over the past five years, though, the trend has been upwards. And getting through my lows has become easier as I have become more confident about my ability to get through.</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right

<a href=\"https://wpengine.com/blog/wp-engine-to-acquire-flywheel/\">has announced</a> that it has reached a definitive agreement to acquire Managed WordPress host, <a href=\"https://getflywheel.com/\">Flywheel</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, Heather Brunner, WP Engine&#8217;s CEO <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/24/wordpress-management-site-wp-engine-acquires-flywheel-as-it-moves-to-a-1b-valuation-and-ipo/\">confirmed to TechCrunch</a> that the company needed to raise a small round of funding to finance the deal. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dusty Davidson, Tony Noecker, and Rick Knudtson founded Flywheel in 2012 in Omaha, Nebraska. In 2012, there were already a handful of players in the Managed WordPress Hosting space but Flywheel was able to carve out a niche by focusing on Designers and Agencies. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2016, Flywheel became one of the few hosting companies added to the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/hosting/\">WordPress.org recommended hosting</a> page. However, their listing was removed a few months later without an explanation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also in 2016, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/flywheel-acquires-wordpress-local-development-tool-pressmatic\">Flywheel acquired Pressmatic</a>, a local WordPress development application for OS X from Clay Griffiths and rebranded it to Local by Flywheel. Representatives from both companies have stated that there are no plans to merge <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-engine-launches-devkit-open-beta\">WP Engine Devkit</a> with Local by Flywheel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to a frequently asked questions document, nothing much is changing in the foreseeable future for Flywheel customers. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Business will continue as usual! There will be no immediate changes to the Flywheel platform, plans, or experience. Weâ€™ll be spending the coming weeks and months on strategic innovation and integration planning, and are super excited to figure out how we can leverage all of our collective strengths, products, and brand assets in the best possible way. </p><cite><a href=\"https://getflywheel.com/flywheel-is-joining-wpengine/\">Acquisition FAQ</a></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Flywheel has generated a loyal following of happy customers over the years and some of them took to Twitter to express their concerns regarding Monday&#8217;s announcement. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Please, please, please don\'t have this be the beginning of the end!

This release introduces a new AMP Stories editor that is powered by Gutenberg. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/AMP-stories-editor.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>AMP Stories are separate from the capabilities that enable AMP for the rest of the website, and they can be used together or independently. The Stories feature has its own post type that uses the block editor and comes with custom blocks that enable the following: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Multiple story pages can be added in a horizontal editing interface</li>\n<li>Page reordering with drag and drop</li>\n<li>Text block (the default instead of Paragraph) allows for text to automatically resize to fit the container</li>\n<li>40 font families for styling the Text block</li>\n<li>Blocks can be dragged and rotated anywhere on a page, with ability to move in front of or behind other blocks</li>\n<li>Select from blank pages or pre-made page templates</li>\n<li>Text block can have varying background color opacity</li>\n<li>Blocks on a given page are listed in a persistent table of contents (with drag and drop)</li>\n<li>Story pages can have background video or image (with focal point)</li>\n<li>Pages can have a solid background color or gradient, including opacity for overlaying background image/video</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The stories created in the editor can also be embedded in other posts and pages using the regular embed block or the Latest Stories block. </p>\n<p>Stories are a mobile-focused format that have become increasingly popular with social networking apps like Snapchat, Instagram, and Facebook. Stories on these platforms are usually created as ephemeral bits of content that are not easy to embed without using a third-party application. Google is marketing AMP stories as &#8220;visual storytelling for the open web.&#8221; </p>\n<p>&#8220;I like to position it as Web Stories,&#8221; Google Developer Relations Program Manager <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tweetythierry\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Thierry Muller</a> said. &#8220;It is powered by AMP, but there are none of the challenges developers might face when making a website AMP compatible. With Web Stories, users are now able to create stories accessible via a simple URL, content that they own and can use open source tools such as the Story editor for WordPress to create stories.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/washpo-amp-stories.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a>Muller said the target audience for AMP stories includes publishers, travel bloggers, food bloggers, and anyone who wants to create immersive content. Some well-known publishers, such as <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/visual-stories/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Telegraph</a>, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/pr/wp/2018/02/13/the-washington-post-launches-custom-story-presentation-with-googles-amp-stories/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Washington Post</a>, and <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/ampstories\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">CNN</a>, have partnered with Google as early adopters, using AMP stories to cover news and events. The Stories also show up in a carousel in mobile search results.</p>\n<p>WordPress users who want to start using the AMP plugin&#8217;s Stories feature will need to have Gutenberg 5.8+ installed, because it requires some of the newer features in the block editor that haven&#8217;t yet be merged into core. </p>\n<p>The addition of AMP Stories to the official AMP plugin may make it more appealing to those who have been hesitant to install it simply for the website capabilities. It gives the plugin another entry point with users who are more interested in the visual storytelling aspect. </p>\n<p>In a recent <a href=\"https://adactio.com/journal/15357\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">post</a> examining the web standards community&#8217;s confusion surrounding how Google Chrome seemed to be unilaterally implementing a new element called toast, Jeremy Keith made a good observation regarding developers&#8217; skepticism about AMP.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I certainly donâ€™t think this is a good look for Google given the debacle of AMPâ€™s &#8216;my way or the highway&#8217; rollout,&#8221; Keith said. &#8220;I know thatâ€™s a completely different team, but the external perception of Google amongst developers has been damaged by the AMP projectâ€™s anti-competitive abuse of Googleâ€™s power in search.&#8221; Google Web Advocate Das Surma lent credibility to Keith&#8217;s take on the matter, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DasSurma/status/1141627540282494977\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">saying</a> it offered &#8220;a pretty accurate representation of our intentions, but also of the problems and mistakes we made.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not easy to quantitatively measure how developers&#8217; anti-AMP sentiment has affected the adoption of Google&#8217;s official AMP plugin for WordPress, especially given the rocky start it had in the official plugin directory. XWP and Google engineers had  a lot to overcome after <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/amp-for-wordpress-plugin-to-introduce-user-friendly-theme-support-settings-in-upcoming-1-0-release\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">taking over the plugin&#8217;s development</a> from Automattic when <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/amp-project-turns-2-automattic-partners-with-google-to-improve-wordpress-plugin\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">users began to wonder if it had been abandoned</a>. </p>\n<p>The first version of the AMP plugin was released in October 2015 and initially had 400 active installs. Over the past four years, that number has grown to more than 400,000 active installs. The plugin has had a 33% increase in its user base from December 1, 2018 (300,000+) to today (400,00+). This is likely due to some of the more user-friendly improvements that have been introduced in the past six months. Google and XWP&#8217;s involvement seems to have successfully dug the plugin out of its previous trend towards negative ratings from users who couldn&#8217;t get any support. </p>\n<p>Nevertheless, Google is still struggling with the challenge to convince WordPress users that the AMP plugin is a must-have addition to their sites. Convincing the wider WordPress ecosystem to build <a href=\"https://amp-wp.org/ecosystem/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">AMP-ready plugins and themes</a> that provide the compatibility for functionality that users&#8217; websites rely on in order to be anything more than a basic blog. Adding AMP stories to the plugin may help to get more WordPress users on board to further explore AMPing up their websites.</p>\n<p>Approximately 410/500 issues and pull requests in version 1.2 were dedicated to the new AMP Stories feature. This release introduces the notion of &#8220;AMP experiences,&#8221; a fancy industry buzz word that divides the Stories and Website features into separate functionality. The website framework improvements include a renaming of the template modes: Native, Paired, and Classic are now Standard, Transitional, and Reader, a strategic and notably less clear way of identifying the modes that seems intended to drive users towards adopting the native AMP approach. The editor has also been updated to display a warning when a featured image is too small for Google Search&#8217;s requirements, as well as provide better block-level warnings and improvements to validation requests.</p>\n<p>Check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/ampproject/amp-wp/releases/tag/1.2.0\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">v1.2 changelog</a> for a full list of everything that is new in this release.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 25 Jun 2019 19:06:28 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:23;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"WPTavern: WordCamp Europe 2020 to be Held in Porto, June 4-6\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=91060\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-europe-2020-to-be-held-in-porto-june-4-6\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12251:\"<p>Another successful edition of WordCamp Europe concluded this weekend in Berlin.

We also had an amazing line-up of speakers with 3 tracks and 3 workshops, along with on-time information shared to our attendees.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>WordCamp Europe 2020 to be Held in Porto, Portugal</h3>\n<p>At the conclusion of the event, organizers announced that next year WCEU is coming to Porto, June 4-6. Porto is Portugal&#8217;s second largest city, known for its beautiful beaches, port wine exports, bridges, vineyards, charming cobblestone streets, and affordability. It also has a vibrant and growing WordPress community. Portugal is home to <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2015/07/09/ze-fontainhas-how-wordcamp-europe-came-to-be/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ZÃ© Fontainhas</a>, one of the original creators of WordCamp Europe. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/josefreitas2/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Jose Freitas</a>, who will be heading up the local team in Portugal, has been working with WordPress since 2008 and has been involved with the community since 2013. He said the Portuguese WordPress community has been working on its application to host WCEU for three years. </p>\n<p>&#8220;We are thrilled to have WCEU in Porto next year,&#8221; Freitas said. &#8220;Portugal is indeed a small country but we have a good WordPress community. At Porto we have had a monthly WordPress Meetup since January 2014, without failing a month. WordPress is growing quickly in Portugal and every day we have people joining our community.&#8221; </p>\n<p>The greater community is connected on Facebook through the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/wpportugal/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress Portugal</a> group, which has more than 4,400 members.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We found that for some people, mostly beginners, itâ€™s difficult to start using the support forums,&#8221; Freitas said. &#8220;So we made a Facebook group and people can ask questions and receive help or feedback related to their projects. Most of the users are people that made their own websites and websites for non profit organizations.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Up until now, Portugal has hosted one WordCamp per year, alternating between Porto and Lisbon locations. Following 2020, local organizers plan to host two camps per year, and WC Lisboa is expected to be scheduled for October 2020.</p>\n<p>The Porto community had formidable competition in its journey to securing the opportunity to host WCEU 2020, beating out Athens, Granada, Manchester, and Torino. Freitas attributes his team&#8217;s success to its dedication to improving Porto&#8217;s application for the past three years, following a disappointing attempt in 2016.</p>\n<p>&#8220;First it was only a dream,&#8221; Freitas said. &#8220;After, it was <em>what ifâ€¦</em> We applied the first time in 2016 to WCEU 2017. We were in the final decision but the event went to Paris, as we all know. So we started right then the application to 2020.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We made it better, stronger, complete with all the new requirements. Each WCEU was getting something new and in each one we added the new thing to our documentation. We made a strict budget, with realistic numbers in all parameters. I think that was important for the people who made the selection.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WCEU 2020 sessions will be held in English. Freitas said the majority of Portuguese people have a good understanding of English and most in the WordPress community are fluent in both languages. </p>\n<p>The maximum capacity for the venue is 8,000 people. WCEU&#8217;s arrangement for 2020 allows attendance to go up to 4,000, in case the event has another record-breaking year.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have a wonderful venue in the city center and surrounded by a garden and a balcony with amazing views of the river and part of the city,&#8221; Freitas said.</p>\n<p>WCEU 2019 local lead Bernhard Kau will be joining the 2020 team as one of the global leads to provide a smooth transition from one year to the next. Attendees can expect some of the successful aspects of the 2019 event to make a return at next year&#8217;s WCEU.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The additions of WP Cafe and Wellness at WCEU were a big success and I would love to have more space for them at WordCamp Europe 2020 in Porto,&#8221; Kau said. &#8220;There are also some other ideas helping attendees staying healthy, both physically and mentally.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As I have never been to Portugal, I am very excited to visit another country. I have met some members of the Portuguese Community on WordCamps throughout Europe and they are some of the most friendly people you can find.&#8221;</p>\n<p>For those who are considering adding WCEU 2020 in Porto to their calendars, Freitas offered a preview of what attendees can expect:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Imagine yourselfâ€¦ it is June, 3, 2020. Thereâ€™s one day to go before WCEU.</p>\n<p>You go to the city center to know a little of the city. You walk in small and narrow streets and find that some of those have a history of more that a thousand years. You ask some directions, because you donâ€™t want to use smartphone maps, and people are nice and even offer to take you to the place that is only 500 meters way.</p>\n<p>You go to the very old part of the city and realize that it wasnâ€™t changed for many, many years. It was not changed because people didnâ€™t want to and because now itâ€™s a UNESCO World Heritage site.</p>\n<p>You sit near the river and look at the bridge designed and build by a student of Eiffel (yep, that Eiffel). The sun has made the Douro river look like silver and you finally get why the Romans gave the name of Porto (port) to the place.</p>\n<p>Itâ€™s time to lunch some tasty and delightful Portuguese food. Donâ€™t skip the dessert. To burn some calories youâ€™ll go to the check the venue.</p>\n<p>You pass the old Reitoria building (the place were the university principal used to work) &#8211; Porto has the biggest Portuguese university &#8211; and see a garden with trees, flowers and even some peacocks.</p>\n<p>You enter there and find the way to the venue: it looks like the top of a spaceship, like the ones in the movies. Thereâ€™s a banner: &#8220;WordCamp Europe 2020.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Now you feel that youâ€™re only a few hours away from the moment you have been waiting for. But, letâ€™s go because you have to see other parts of the city.</p>\n<p>The next day, you join hundreds of WordPress people who are helping the community in Contributor Day. There is a lot to do before the two conference days and workshops, before visiting the sponsors area, before meeting some of the nice folks that you didnâ€™t see since last year, before making new friends.</p>\n<p>After all, itâ€™s possible to make new friends in an event of thousands of people.</p></blockquote>\n<p>WordCamp Europe is made possible every year by a massive team of organizers and volunteers who help keep costs low, in addition to sponsors. </p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The organising team would like to thank all of the volunteers for contributing to an amazing <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WCEU?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WCEU</a>! <a href=\"https://t.co/1um7usNZqT\">pic.twitter.com/1um7usNZqT</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; WordCamp Europe (@WCEurope) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WCEurope/status/1142455860683333632?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 22, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>The 2020 team put out the <a href=\"https://2020.europe.wordcamp.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">call for organizers</a> after announcing the host city.

This section contains fields that enable users to share how much time they contribute to WordPress on a weekly basis, which teams they contribute to, and whether or not those contributions are sponsored. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img />New WordPress.org User Profile Fields</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Each field is optional and will only appear if the Hours and Teams fields are filled in. The sponsored tag will only appear next to the Contributions heading if you answer Yes to being sponsored and the other fields are filled in. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Andrea Middleton describes these fields as a step towards a possible version one of the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/updates/2018/11/05/proposal-five-for-the-future-acknowledgement-page/\">Five for the Future program</a> that was published last year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I think it will also help with transparency, and might facilitate how teams set internal expectations for how much time different contributors might have to spend on a project or ongoing task,&#8221; she said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the profile fields, the official <a href=\"https://jobs.wordpress.net/\">WordPress Jobs Board</a> has also been updated to include a new <a href=\"https://jobs.wordpress.net/job_category/contributor/\">Contributor position</a>. The goal is to make it easier for companies to find and hire people interested in becoming sponsored contributors. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>These changes are the first iteration with plans to enhance them in the future.

This may aid in transparency and avoiding conflicts of interests. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other side of the coin, does it make sense for the company&#8217;s name to be public information, or should contributors only share that information with team leads or reps on a 1-on-1 basis? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel as though knowing someone&#8217;s contributions are sponsored is only half of the equation. Without knowing who the sponsor is, that information is practically irrelevant. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 22 Jun 2019 01:17:01 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:25;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:125:\"WPTavern: Matt Mullenwegâ€™s Summer Update at WordCamp Europe 2019: Gutenbergâ€™s Progress and a Preview of Upcoming Features\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=91000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:129:\"https://wptavern.com/matt-mullenwegs-summer-update-at-wordcamp-europe-2019-gutenbergs-progress-and-a-preview-of-upcoming-features\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11361:\"<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/matt-wceu-2019.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a>image credit: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/WCEurope/photos/a.345903435550204/1343533289120542/\">WCEU Photography Team</a></p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg took the stage at WordCamp Europe in Berlin this afternoon to give a summer update on the progress of the block editor. He attributed much of its continued success to the availability of the Gutenberg plugin, which allows for quick iteration and testing. More than 150,000 posts are published per day using the block editor, which Mullenweg said is &#8220;a testament to the long development period&#8221; that gave the team an opportunity to work out bugs and make it usable for a large number of people.</p>\n<p>Since its initial release, the block editor has added a host of notable improvements, including block management capabilities, a cover block with nested elements, widgets as blocks, block grouping, and snackbar style notices. </p>\n<p>Mullenweg highlighted a few beautiful and innovative examples of Gutenberg in the wild. Two projects from <a href=\"https://humanmade.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Human Made</a> showcase Gutenberg-powered designs (<a href=\"https://www.artefactgroup.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">artefactgroup.com</a>) and an AI integration that analyzes a user&#8217;s writing in the editor (<a href=\"https://ingenuity.siemens.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ingenuity.siemens.com</a>.) </p>\n<p>Election season is ramping up in the U.S. and Gutenberg-powered sites, like <a href=\"https://hurst4delegate.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">hurst4delegate.com</a>, are starting to pop up. Mullenweg noted that 21/24 of the current democratic candidates for President are using WordPress for their sites. <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Whitehouse.gov</a> also switched from Drupal to WordPress earlier this year. </p>\n<p>Mullenweg also gave a quick preview of some of the upcoming Gutenberg features that are currently being developed on GitHub. Most of them are still in the prototype stage. The team is creating a system to install new blocks online, which will tie into the planned block directory. Mullenweg said Blocks could become a new top-level menu item in the WordPress admin, with screens dedicated to block discovery. </p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\"A block directory is coming that will take over other â€œtop level navigationâ€ and brings a â€œplayfulnessâ€ to discovering <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Gutenberg?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Gutenberg</a> blocks.â€ <a href=\"https://twitter.com/photomatt?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@photomatt</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WCEU?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WCEU</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WordPress?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WordPress</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/wsiHcPaVuL\">pic.twitter.com/wsiHcPaVuL</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; David Bisset (@dimensionmedia) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dimensionmedia/status/1142044607800369153?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 21, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>He showed demos of the navigation block in progress, a prototype for adding realistic motion to block movement, an experimental footnotes block, and a demo of resizing images with &#8220;snap to grid&#8221; capabilities. Mullenweg said one of the goals with Gutenberg is to &#8220;make it possible to create beautiful experiences, because thatâ€™s part of what the web needs to win.â€ </p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">New footnotes feature being tested in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Gutenberg?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Gutenberg</a>. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/photomatt?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@photomatt</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WCEU?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WCEU</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WordPress?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WordPress</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/b8yhn2X71w\">pic.twitter.com/b8yhn2X71w</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; David Bisset (@dimensionmedia) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dimensionmedia/status/1142045330969640961?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 21, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mullenweg also gave an update on Gutenberg&#8217;s progress in the mobile apps. He said the new editor is operational but development is slow moving because the mobile engineers essentially have to duplicate all of the work that has been done by hundreds of Gutenberg contributors thus far. </p>\n<h3>Q&#038;A Highlights Governance, Core Maintenance, and the Future of WordPress Themes</h3>\n<p>The Q&#038;A portion of the session featured a variety of topics, ranging from an aggressive tirade about licensing and Envato, to more relevant inquiries about the future of WordPress themes. While this format of interaction has its shortcomings, it gives community members the opportunity to check on the status of issues where they have a particular interest. </p>\n<p>One attendee asked if WordPress.org plans to implement a more democratic structure for decision making. Mullenweg seemed to interpret the question as referencing a system where tens or hundreds of millions of WordPress users would participate in making decisions on features through a vote or some other form of feedback. In contrast, he said WordPress&#8217; current approach is for leadership to try to get a sense for what the most common issues are through polls and public channels and allow those issues to help shape the project&#8217;s roadmap. </p>\n<p>Mullenweg shared that one particular issue on his mind right now is the problem of &#8220;how do I make my theme look like the demo?&#8221; He said contributors are experimenting with different types of models for making decisions that move WordPress in the direction to solve these types of problems. </p>\n<p>He said that the project&#8217;s decision making is fairly transparent, without a lot of mystery, and that the community has tons of feedback mechanisms. This is a somewhat controversial claim, as <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/updates/2019/04/26/5-0-release-retrospective-wrap-up/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">regular project contributors have expressed frustration with the lack of communication</a> surrounding important planning and decisions, such as release dates and project timing, as it pertained to how WordPress 5.0 landed. The community was frustrated by a lack of effective ways to communicate critical issues and complaints to project leadership. As a followup to this specific feedback, Josepha Haden, the new Executive Director of the WordPress project, has been diligent to track and communicate how leadership is working to improve communication.</p>\n<p>Another attendee asked if WordPress themes will become obsolete after Gutenberg gains more site-building capabilities. Mullenweg predicted they will always be a part of WordPress but seemed inclined to let the market decide the fate of themes.</p>\n<p>â€œI donâ€™t know,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They are going to change for sure. I donâ€™t think they ever go away.â€ He said he could see developers offering an array of different designs that could be used as a starting point. Although a WordPress theme has a very specific definition right now (as far as what types of files are included), Mullenweg said he can see that  definition evolving over time. He said he could see themes becoming like a starter template or a library of patterns to choose from, or even a set of complex layouts that could work across different themes. </p>\n<p>â€œI think weâ€™re going to decouple themes a little bit but I donâ€™t know how or what that will look like,â€ Mullwenweg said. He also noted that a lot of themes right now represent a similar aesthetic, often business minimalist that use white and blue colors. Design trends have the potential to shift dramatically as Gutenberg and themes evolve to allow users more control over how their sites are designed.</p>\n<p>It is no secret that the WordPress development community is eager to switch to GitHub or another Git-based infrastructure for core development. Most of the recent feature projects have successfully matured on GitHub, with the majority of work and discussion taking place outside of Trac. One attendee asked about the possibility of moving away from Trac in the near future. Mullenweg said that this year the team that works on WordPress.org is prioritizing changes to the directory, but in the meantime anyone with Python knowledge is welcome to contribute to tweaking Trac for improvements in the interim before WordPress moves to Git-based development.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Iâ€™d love to move off of Trac as much as the next person. In the interim Iâ€™m working some cool tools to make life easier using the Elasticsearch cluster I built for it. Let me know if you want to help! <a href=\"https://t.co/E26P66ebmQ\">https://t.co/E26P66ebmQ</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WCEU?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WCEU</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; William Earnhardt (@earnjam) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/earnjam/status/1142057095044444160?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 21, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>In response to a question about blockchain technology and WordPress, Mullenweg said he has long been an enthusiast in this area and loves the idea of open source applying to money, as well as having a distributed ledger. </p>\n<p>&#8220;But I canâ€™t think of any problem in core WordPress right now that the overhead of a blockchain would really improve,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Everything I could think of right now would probably be plugin territory.&#8221; However, he said that the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/new-wordproof-plugin-timestamps-wordpress-content-on-the-blockchain\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WordProof plugin&#8217;s timestamping WordPress content</a> on the blockchain is among one of the best ideas he has seen for this technology so far.</p>\n<p>When asked how he plans to &#8220;balance chasing the new and shiny with all of WordPress&#8217; existing legacy APIs,&#8221; Mullenweg said that &#8220;PHP is going to be crucial to us for many years to come.&#8221; He recognized that the project has fallen behind in maintenance with some of its older APIs but that work on Gutenberg can be done in parallel. </p>\n<p>The new triage team is currently going through all the tickets, refreshing patches, and working on taking them to resolution. Mullenweg noted that WordCamp Europe hosted the first ever triage table at its contributor day and said that this new area is ripe for contribution.</p>\n<p>The REST API, despite its broad support and noteworthy contributors, is one area that Mullenweg said has held Gutenberg back. He said it still does not have the demonstrated use that its advocates predicted when working to get it merged into core and cautioned that WordPress should always use an API first before shipping it to the world.</p>\n<p>Mullenweg concluded the Q&#038;A by estimating that Gutenberg is only 10% of the way down the road towards solving the problems that WordPress contributors set out to tackle. He predicts that building on this initial effort will carry into the next decade.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 21 Jun 2019 18:48:30 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"WPTavern: Free Event: Post Status to Live Stream Publish Online July 8-9\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=90922\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"https://wptavern.com/free-event-post-status-to-live-stream-publish-online-july-8-9\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1674:\"<p><a href=\"https://poststatus.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Post Status</a> will be live streaming <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/publish/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Publish Online</a> on July 8-9, 2019.

It is used by tens of thousands of developers and downloaded nearly 500,000 times each month.</p>\n<p>Gatsby founder Kyle Mathews created <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gatsby Inc</a>. as a company to further the project&#8217;s goals, and <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2018-05-24-launching-new-gatsby-company/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">received $3.8M in seed funding</a> in May 2018. The investment is being used to build cloud services for Gatsby and improve Gatsby&#8217;s core open source software. As the company has grown, Gatsby is beginning to invest more heavily in the open source ecosystem that surrounds the project.</p>\n<p>With WordPress powering <a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress/all/all\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">34% of the top 10 million websites</a>, it&#8217;s only natural that Gatsby would look to WPGraphQL, one of the most promising projects in the WP ecosystem, for its next investment in open source. The more WordPress developers Gatsby can get using GraphQL and JavaScript, the more it benefits the greater Gatsby ecosystem.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The number of developers using Gatsby to build sites where the content is managed by WordPress is growing,&#8221; Bahl said. &#8220;The current `gatsby-source-wordpress` plugin pulls data into Gatsby using the WordPress REST API, but the REST API has a lot of pain points that are proving to be very difficult to get past.</p>\n<p>&#8220;WPGraphQL solves many of those pain points already, and has potential to solve even more. The more robust WPGraphQL is, the better it is for all JavaScript consumers, whether it be Next.js, Gridsome (a Vue static site generator) or Gatsby.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Bahl followed the Gatsby project from afar before striking up a relationship with the team through the various Slack channels where the community is active. A year and a half ago, he moved the <a href=\"http://docs.wpgraphql.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">docs.wpgraphql.com</a> site from WordPress to Gatsby, where the content is stored in Markdown files on Github. This allows users in the community to contribute to the docs by submitting pull requests.</p>\n<p>In February 2019, Bahl gave a presentation at WordCamp Phoenix on &#8220;<a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2019/03/08/jason-bahl-building-static-sites-with-wordpress-gatsby-and-wpgraphql/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Building Static Sites with WordPress, Gatsby and WPGraphQL</a>&#8221; After that he saw more growth in the  crossover ecosystems &#8211; more people in the Gatsby Slack asking about WordPress, and more developers in the WPGraphQL Slack asking about Gatsby.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been following all things GraphQL for a few years, so Gatsby has been on my radar for a while as Gatsby uses GraphQL to create a &#8216;content mesh&#8217; where data can be pulled from many sources into one Gatsby site,&#8221; Bahl said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The more I followed Gatsby from afar, the more intrigued I was. The development experience of Gatsby is great, especially if you enjoy React, which I do.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Bahl is active in both Slacks, on both GitHub repos, and on Twitter, helping people build Gatsby sites with WordPress and GraphQL, which is how he developed a relationship with the team.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In mid April I made it known to a few people that I would love to work on WPGraphQL full-time if I had the opportunity,&#8221; he said. &#8220;On May 30, Kyle Matthews direct messaged me on Twitter saying Gatsby is planning on investing in WordPress more and they&#8217;d love to chat. The following week I had some video calls with Kyle, Sam, and some other folks on the Gatsby team, and they made me a formal offer to join the Gatsby teams to make WPGraphQL the best it can be.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The WPGraphQL project already has a <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wpgraphql-project-gains-momentum-with-growing-library-of-extensions-for-popular-wordpress-projects\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">rapidly growing library of extensions</a> for popular WordPress plugins, despite the fact that the project has not yet reached a stable 1.0 release. Bahl&#8217;s new opportunity with the Gatsby team will enable him to work with the community&#8217;s momentum to get WPGraphQL further on its roadmap.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Working on WPGraphQL full time will allow me to work on features and bugs that Iâ€™ve not had adequate time to focus on while also maintaining a full time job,&#8221; Bahl said.  </p>\n<p>&#8220;WPGraphQL is used in production by many already, but itâ€™s still pre 1.0 because of some breaking changes I foresee but havenâ€™t had adequate time to dedicate to addressing.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Bahl will also be available to provide better resources for the community, such as documentation, example codebases, and courses and tutorials, in addition to attending more WordCamps and other conferences, participating in podcasts, and interacting on GitHub issues, Slack, and other communication channels.  </p>\n<p>&#8220;It will also provide more time to focus on conversations on whether GraphQL should be part of WordPress core (or not), and educate the community and core maintainers on the tradeoffs,&#8221; Bahl said. </p>\n<p>In hiring Bahl to work on WPGraphQL, Gatsby is making a significant investment in the WordPress community that depends on this project. The improved support and quicker pace of development should bring peace of mind to those who are already using WPGraphQL in production. </p>\n<p>&#8220;Iâ€™ll also be working closely with other members of the Gatsby team to make the experience of using Gatsby with WordPress a great experience,&#8221; Bahl said. &#8220;We have a lot of ideas about how WPGraphQL can make the Gatsby + WordPress experience a fantastic one for developers and users alike.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 20 Jun 2019 19:52:07 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"WPTavern: WooCommerce.com Clarifies Its Policy on Selling CBD Products\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=90955\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"https://wptavern.com/woocommerce-com-clarifies-its-policy-on-selling-cbd-products\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6948:\"<p>Last week, a member of the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/woohelp/\">WooCommerce Help and Share Facebook</a> group who sells Cannabidiol or CBD products submitted a post that included an email exchange with WooCommerce support. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the exchange, the support rep explained to the store owner that when their WooCommerce.com account was connected to a WordPress.com login, it then fell under the <a href=\"https://en.support.wordpress.com/store-guidelines/\">WordPress.com store guidelines</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the guidelines, controlled substances (including marijuana, cannabidiol or CBD, and other cannabis-derived products) are not allowed to be sold. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The support rep goes on to say that this included but was not limited to sites using WordPress.com, the Jetpack plugin, and any extensions from WooCommerce.com.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The store owner is then informed that their store will be disconnected from Automattic hosted services if they continue to sell CBD products.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Legal Document Becomes a Source of Confusion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The support rep provided the store owner with a link to the most <a href=\"https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-cbd/\">frequently asked questions</a> on selling CBD products using WooCommerce. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The wording of the document made it seem as though there was a difference between downloading the plugin from the WordPress plugin directory or WooCommerce.com. It also appeared to apply limits on how the GPL licensed software could be used. Here is a cached version of the original document. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>Can WooCommerce be used to sell cannabis-derived products such as CBD oil? </strong></p><p><strong>Yes</strong>, if you download the WooCommerce plugin directly from WordPress.org or install the WooCommerce plugin via the Plugins page of your site from WordPress.org.</p><p><strong>No</strong>, if you download and install the WooCommerce plugin directly from WooCommerce.com.</p><p>It is the same WooCommerce plugin, but the location of download makes a difference?<strong><br />Whatâ€™s the difference?</strong> <br />The difference is ownership.</p><p>WooCommerce from <strong>WordPress.org</strong> is open-source software and is hosted through a third-party company.</p><p>WooCommerce from <strong>WooCommerce.com and WordPress.com</strong> is hosted through Automattic.

As our software is open source, we do not limit its use. </p><p>However, while you can use the code of our WooCommerce plugin to sell products derived from cannabis and hemp, you cannot use <strong>services</strong> offered directly by Automattic to support those stores. This is the case whether the products are over or under 0.3% THC, and whether they are derived from hemp or cannabis. Automatticâ€™s direct services include, but are not limited to, WordPress.com, WooCommerce.com, and the Jetpack plugin.</p><p>This means that you can use the open source WooCommerce plugin to sell cannabis-derived products, but you cannot:</p><p><s>Connect your site to Automatticâ€™s servers in </s><em><s>WooCommerce > Extensions > WooCommerce.com Subscriptions</s></em><s> for automatic extension updates or at WordPress.com.</s></p><p>Use WooCommerce services that depend on a Jetpack connection, such as <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/products/shipping/\">WooCommerce Shipping</a> or <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/products/tax/\">WooCommerce Tax</a>. </p><p>Host your site on WordPress.com. </p><p><strong>Can I get help for my WooCommerce store?</strong><br />Yes. Our WooCommerce.com help desk can assist you with your site if you would normally qualify to receive support. You might also receive help from others in the WordPress.org  forums or the WooCommerce community.</p><cite>Revised WooCommerce and CBD Products FAQ</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>In the last two years, WooCommerce has increasingly relied on Jetpack and its connection to WordPress.com&#8217;s infrastructure to provide services. These include <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/products/shipping/\">WooCommerce Shipping</a>, the <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/mobile/\">WooCommerce app</a>, and <a href=\"https://blog.taxjar.com/woocommerce-services-automated-tax-calculations-powered-taxjar/\">Automated Tax Calculations</a>. In 2017, <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/posts/wooconf-state-of-the-woo/\">Todd Wilkens made it clear</a> that WooCommerce would continue to make extensive use of Jetpack to provide cloud services.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the policy makes things clearer, CBD store owners will need to determine if they can live without the conveniences provided by Jetpack, WooCommerce.com, and WordPress.com. This situation is also a reminder to all store owners to double check a service&#8217;s policies before connecting any sites. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Updated on June 25th, 2019. </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WooCommerce has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pmaiorana/status/1143590019849949184\">updated its policy</a> to allow automatic updates from WooCommerce.com </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 20 Jun 2019 01:02:24 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:31;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"WPTavern: Watch the Free WordCamp Europe 2019 Live Stream June 21-22\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=90487\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:79:\"https://wptavern.com/watch-the-free-wordcamp-europe-2019-live-stream-june-21-22\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2026:\"<p><a href=\"https://2019.europe.wordcamp.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WordCamp Europe 2019</a> kicks off tomorrow, June 20, with Contributor Day.

And it was a fantastic talk with Speakers.</p>\n<p>By the time you read this, I would have experienced my first international talk in<a href=\"https://2019.europe.wordcamp.org/sessions/\"> WordCamp Europe 2019</a> at<a href=\"https://2019.europe.wordcamp.org/2019/04/30/wp-cafe/\"> WPCafe</a>. And would have moved to the next :). In this essay, I will be sharing how I found my career path, how WordPress changed my life, why I took challenges. I am a non-technical person, if you are a newbie, struggling with your career, stopped taking challenges, gave up and lose hope, especially womenâ€™s, then this may be your compelling decision to be here. I am sharing my short story towards WordPress and putting some points that make me take these decisions.</p>\n<h3>Who am I?</h3>\n<p>My name is<a href=\"https://afsanamultani.com/about-afsana/\"> Afsana Multani</a>, an artist by hobby and a WordPress enthusiast. You must think, why and how I work with WordPress? WordPress wasnâ€™t the first choice in my life. My very first choice was painting. I didn&#8217;t even know I will be starting working with WordPress. :) To learn and work with WordPress, became the dream of my life, to follow this, I started working as a Customer Support Executive at theDotstore, which is a Venture of MULTIDOTS.</p>\n<p>I was born &amp; brought up in a reserved middle-class family, residing in Bhavnagar, a small city of Gujarat, India. Currently, I live in Ahmedabad. The family thinking is one which follows age-old customs and traditions and has stayed away from innovations. Where, most of the time, children do not have the freedom to dream, to develop, or to choose their life, to do something new. As a child, I had everything needed to live a better life &#8211; food, shelter, and clothes. But one thing was missing &#8211; â€œfreedom.â€ I am the second one of four kids in my family and was lucky enough to study further.</p>\n<p>Though I never had a chance to talk with my father about my career, and what I want to do in life or how life will be after studies. I was sure I have to do something and make my parents proud.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Besides all the strict rules and conventional thinking, my parents trusted me and allowed me to study further.</p></blockquote>\n<p>My mother never pushed me to cook or do household chores, as she spends her entire life doing this stuff. She loved to study, but due to this old thinking pattern, she had to drop her studies after her 3rd Standard. She starts cooking at home, with all household chores, preparing to get married one day.</p>\n<p>You would say, itâ€™s not an age to do this. But it was her childhood, where other children were playing with toys, she continued playing with real-life. She determined never give up; whatever I am today because of her if she does not do that I would never have the courage to study further. I was good in studies, and get 1st in every Curriculum activity; the reason was my parents. I wanted to see them happy and proud. I learned one thing from her &#8211;</p>\n<blockquote><p>Never give up on your dreams, work harder for what you want, and help others.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I always have struggled for my future path, I wasnâ€™t sure what to do and what not to, but I learned not to be afraid of taking challenges. During the time, I was about to step into the new phase of life &#8211; â€œMarriage.â€</p>\n<h3>Everything changed</h3>\n<p>In my sweet 16, my wedding fixed already. And my father asked me to drop studies after 10th and plan for marriage. But my mother wanted me to study; so, she convinced him. Fortunately, my life partner was also so understanding and carrying. We never met before our engagement day, but I still remember, as soon as we had our first phone call, we fell in Love. Just like that &#8211; like a Fairy Tale.</p>\n<p>Suddenly everything changes when the day came to leave my parents home. I got married early after my Higher Secondary School at the age of 18. I was a child with no idea how everything goes after marriage but has to take the responsibilities. It was a new challenge &#8211; family and household chores. Understanding new families make them happy and still living in a joint family was a challenge to decide on a career. I remember one my Grandpa says,</p>\n<blockquote><p>â€œlife will never be better, but we have to make it betterâ€</p></blockquote>\n<h3>Can a Hobby be a Profession?</h3>\n<p>So, the answer is yes. If your hobby wakes you up in the middle of your sleep, it does. But if you let someone entering into your hobby, then it may be challenging for you to continue further. For me, the painting was my hobby, since childhood. I never found a tutor to polish my skills and learned it myself as an inspiration from my elder sister. It was a dream to be a great artist one day; I decided to join the institute after my marriage. I initiated my first painting classes name â€œ<a href=\"https://afsanamultani.com/my-studio/\">AKSA</a>,â€ I enjoy with kids; my motto was to encourage them to develop their skills.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Studio.jpg\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>I did not have a better teacher in my childhood, so I wanted them to have one and not to struggle much to follow their path. Destiny has some other plans.</p>\n<h3>Introduction to the computer world</h3>\n<p>I also have learned PHP for a couple of months. But that was not something I am happy with so I continued my journey, finding some more opportunities.</p>\n<p>In 2012, I found my first job out of my hobby with a full-service WordPress agency &#8211;<a href=\"https://www.multidots.com/\"> MULTIDOTS</a> as a front-end developer; I had picked up quite a bit of Photoshop designing as well as HTML. Work with photoshop was fun to play with computer. I did not have a computer at home, so this job was fascinating. I decided it quickly and started building websites and learning HTML responsive coding, on my own &#8211; Google was my teacher. I love learning new things which match to my nature and interest :).</p>\n<p>I was perfectly happy as a front-end developer, yet I always felt as if there were some other types of work that I would adore more. â€œI just didn&#8217;t know what it was,â€ in 2017, I started working with WordPress.</p>\n<p>The decision to start working with WordPress comes with challenges. It feels like going back to the first-level of schooling, taking classes to pick up necessary qualification.</p>\n<p>For me, everything changed in my early 20â€™s. At 25, my brain woke up &#8211; it certainly feels like that. And I managed to win a job as a â€œCustomer Support Executiveâ€ at<a href=\"https://www.thedotstore.com/\"> thedotstore</a>. I am a talkative person, and chatting with people around the world was amazing. As my Mom says, &#8211; help, support, and make people happy. Working freely with fun was one of my visions that comes true.</p>\n<p>Thedotstore develops free and premium plugins for WooCommerce, with a focus on scalability, performance, and security. Customer satisfaction is the key success to thedotstore or any businesses. While working with IT company being a frontend developer, I came into contact with WordPress and found we can create a blog easily. But it was way far knowing about its vast community.</p>\n<h3>My first WordPress Blog</h3>\n<p>It was an enjoyable experience working on my first WordPress painting blog in 2014. :) I do not have an active link, because it was on a local server for practice.</p>\n<p>But I have recently created a new Blog â€œ<a href=\"https://afsanamultani.com/\">afsanamultani.com</a>â€ &#8211; which is live and active :) Where I have shared my journey being with Painting Studio as well as my experiences in contribution to WordPress.</p>\n<h3>My First interaction with WordPress Community</h3>\n<p>WordPress Ahmedabad community already started Organizing<a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/ahmedabad-wp-meetup/\"> WPMeetups</a> and also planning for the first WordCamp in 2017. I participated as Volunteer in my first<a href=\"https://2017.ahmedabad.wordcamp.org/\"> WordCamp Ahmedabad 2017</a>, Also have created a beautiful Selfie Booth with the team. During the day, for the first time in my life, I took the initiative to talk to different people about WordPress, got an opportunity to meet WordPress lovers, Automattician &#8211;<a href=\"https://automattic.com/work-with-us/happiness-engineer/\"> Happiness Engineer</a>, Nomad, people working remotely. Those words were new to me, and I was like- what are you saying! For me, it was a dream, â€œI was born for this man.â€ At the same time, I decided to be a Happiness Engineer one day. WordPress is not only a platform for a techie guy; it also helps a person like me to select their career path with WordPress. Doesn&#8217;t sound interesting?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/WCAhmedabad2017.jpg\"><img /></a></p>\n<h3>A break that got me where I am today</h3>\n<p>It was my first day when I started learning more about WordPress and its community. In November 2017, WordPress was at version 4.9.1, and I was getting in. I spend days tweaking and learning about customer support, forums, and how to get involved. I wanted to be a part of the WordPress team.</p>\n<h3>Steps I followed</h3>\n<p>Step one:- with understanding the code of conduct and how the<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/\"> community</a> works.</p>\n<p>Step two:- How to get involved &#8211;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/\"> make.wordpress.org</a></p>\n<p>Step three:- What are the channels and how it works.</p>\n<p>Step Four:- Go to the team channels and start surfing.</p>\n<p>Step Five:- Join the<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\"> slack channels</a>, where you get the support and knowledge. Itâ€™s easy to join the public slack channel #forums #community-events #community-team and more.</p>\n<p>As we know, it is not easy to get started and understand everything overnight. At first, when I joined these slack channels, I found lots of people chatting and sharing information, some asking for help and some are staff who helped people to solve their problems.</p>\n<h3>First Week with WordPress</h3>\n<p>My very first week went only on reviewing those chat conversations and how to get involved. So if you are new and want to get into this, be there for a while, don&#8217;t try to understand everything at first. Please go through all the chat conversations, and gradually, you will know how it works.</p>\n<p>Itâ€™s a great platform to work; if you ask me how long I can work with WordPress, I would like to work with WordPress forever. Itâ€™s like I never think to change the platform since WordPress helps me to work freely and who does not love Freedom? :)</p>\n<blockquote><p>Dedication, Hard work, Patience, and Reading will always make you successful in any Career you choose.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I was a newbie, and I didn&#8217;t even imagine it will be a fantastic journey. It took me a year to understand the community. I am now working as a customer support executive, still learning and exploring new ways of contributing to WordPress.</p>\n<h3>Volunteer work</h3>\n<p>During this time, I have attended several WordCamps, and I got opportunities in organizing, speaking, and volunteering.</p>\n<h3>WordCamp Organizing Experience</h3>\n<p>After WordCamp Ahmedabad 2017, it was time for our second WordCamp. We started planning for the next Lead Organiser for the event. By the time of deciding for the woman candidate. Everyone asked me if I am ready to take this challenge. My first expression was &#8211; What? Are you kidding me? It&#8217;s a dream, someone, please wake me up, :D I asked many questions at the same time. I asked myself for a while, Am I ready for the big challenge? What if I could not make it? And I recall those words &#8211; never give up, take a challenge, and try harder than what you want.</p>\n<p>I accepted the challenge, started reading<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer/become-an-organizer/\"> WordCamp Organizer HandBook</a> from WordPress.org site. Thereâ€™s each and everything mentioned very clear from Applying Application to the<a href=\"https://central.wordcamp.org/schedule/\"> WordCamp Central,</a> where you find all the upcoming WordCamp lists and the End of the event process. It was a fantastic experience of<a href=\"https://2018.ahmedabad.wordcamp.org/organizers/\"> WordCamp Ahmedabad 2018</a>. There is one thing that I learn from this event, if you are ready to take the challenge, everyone will help you to fulfill that challenge. And it was never possible without my team and Aditya Kane, who was the mentor for the event. We are an excellent team of organizers.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Organisers.jpg\"><img /></a></p>\n<h3>WordCamp Speaking Experience</h3>\n<p>After volunteering, organizing, it was my dream to be a speaker. And I was fortunate to speak in<a href=\"https://2019.kolkata.wordcamp.org/speakers/\"> WordCamp Kolkata 2019</a>. I was so happy when I got an Email with â€œCongratulations.â€ Now, what? Let us prepare.</p>\n<p>Sharing<a href=\"https://speakerdeck.com/afsana/20-effective-ways-to-build-a-better-customer-experience\"> â€œ20 Effective Ways to Build a Better Customer Experienceâ€</a> was a great experience in my life; I never imagined such a huge audience and a great team. By this time I have also contributed to upload WordCamp video on<a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2019/04/10/afsana-multani-20-effective-ways-to-build-a-better-customer-experience/\"> WordPress.tv</a>. Learning Never Ends!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Speaker.jpg\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>If you are reading this, and also have a dream to be a speaker, the first thing you need to do is, write your topic and send it over. Do not think much; push that Share Button, thatâ€™s all. Sometimes, weâ€™re afraid to push that button and miss the excellent opportunity. If you think next time, write everything, and I would be happy to push that button for you. :D Especially women, it would be so lovely to see you, take this challenge and start living your dreams. Do not be afraid of making mistakes, remember &#8211; â€œevery successful person made mistakesâ€ even Gandhiji, but he learned from his mistakes and promised never to repeat.</p>\n<h3>â€œTake new challenges, make mistakes, learn, and improve.â€</h3>\n<p>Moving further to contributions, it is always fun working with your love. I believe &#8211; â€œLove what you do and do what you Love,â€ and it works.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>WordPress Support Forums</li>\n<li>WordPress TV Contributor</li>\n<li>WordPress Polyglots Editor</li>\n<li>WordPress Polyglots Contributor</li>\n<li>WordPress Meetup Organizer</li>\n<li>WordCamp Volunteer</li>\n<li>WordCamp Lead Organizer</li>\n<li>WordCamp Speaker</li>\n<li>WordPress Polyglots Translation Team</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I have done what I love, and what about you?</p>\n<p>Most importantly, I am glad to be a contributor. There&#8217;s one more thing &#8211; The<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/afsanamultanii/\"> badges</a> are the best part of WordPress I have ever seen, and it&#8217;s like a volunteer reward.</p>\n<p>So ladies and gentleman, How many badges have you collected? Share your list in comments :)</p>\n<h3>My initiative</h3>\n<p>After experiencing my contribution to WordPress, people come up with various questions, &#8211; how you have done this, and how to get involved in the community, what steps to be followed to contribute. So that makes me start this initiative <a href=\"https://iamwplearner.com/\">iamwplearner</a> as a knowledge sharing activity with a dream of helping the local as well as WordPress community through different channels and languages.</p>\n<p>Good Takeaways â€“ iamwplearner helps beginners, startup, and college students, who are looking for the opportunity and how to involve with WordPress.</p>\n<p>Everything was possible only with the help of<a href=\"https://aslam.blog/\"> Aslam Multani</a>. He is my supporter, my backbone, and my reason for life, he is the person who always guides me and motivates me in all situations.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Afsana-Aslam.jpg\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Like me, most late achievers will discover that they have more significant opportunities to succeed on alternative paths. But, todayâ€™s obsessive way for new achievement is the fear of failure for those who do not attain it. They waste our national talent and stunted creativity.</p>\n<h3>If I can do this, You can do this even better. :)</h3>\n<p>All of us love someone and something, and the thing is we cannot give up on ourselves or others- especially if society has made it harder to catch up. Most people recently born will live in the 22nd century, and they will accept the modernization in the community. This is us; a healthy society needs all of its people to recognize that they can bloom and re-bloom, grow, and succeed throughout their lives.</p>\n<p>I like to address this commitment, to all WordPress fans, especially a local womens community, to show your real talent, and break the stereotypes. Let people speak, there will be a doubt, a mistake, but if you are confident in you, no one can stop doing your best. :)<br />\nI wish you Good Luck.</p>\n<h3>Whatâ€™s in the Future?</h3>\n<p>I would say, the future is yet to come. Be yourself, there are many opportunities, challenges, and learnings. I try myself ready for better today than yesterday.

This capability has traditionally been handled by plugins, which provide a variety of implementations. The goal of this new feature project is to ship basic XML sitemaps in core while providing an XML Sitemaps API for plugin developers to extend. It would also update WordPress&#8217; robots.txt file to reference the sitemap index. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/TweetyThierry\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Thierry Muller</a>, a Developer Relations Program Manager at Google, published the details of the collaborators&#8217; plans on WordPress.org. The sitemaps included in core would be enabled by default and would index the following content:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Homepage</li>\n<li>Posts page</li>\n<li>Core Post Types (Pages and Posts)</li>\n<li>Custom Post Types</li>\n<li>Core Taxonomies (Tags and Categories)</li>\n<li>Custom Taxonomies</li>\n<li>Users (Authors)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Although WordPress contributors have had multiple discussions regarding XML sitemaps on trac, Muller said there had not yet been a group to take ownership and get things moving forward. His proposal notes that 4 out of the top 15 plugins in the WordPress plugin directory ship with their own implementation of XML. Despite the demonstrated high demand for XML sitemaps,  the right team for getting this added to core had not been assembled until now.</p>\n<p>&#8220;XML Sitemaps is a standard across all search engines these days and any website with content which is intended to be indexed should have one,&#8221; Muller said. &#8220;Having XML Sitemaps in core would speed up content discoverability and indexing. We started discussing this topic last year with Yoast and agreed that it would be great to finally make it happen.&#8221;</p>\n<p>So far the initiative has received a favorable response from the community and has already gained the support of WordPress project lead Matt Mullenweg. </p>\n<p>&#8220;This makes a lot of sense, looking forward to seeing the v1 of this in core and for it to evolve in future releases and cement WordPressâ€™ well-deserved reputation of being the best CMS for SEO,&#8221; Mullenweg commented on the proposal. </p>\n<p>Performance is one of the primary concerns that the WordPress development community has expressed regarding adding XML sitemaps to core. </p>\n<p>&#8220;As simple and straightforward as XML sitemaps are, they present some relatively significant performance challenges at scale,&#8221; Matthew Boynes, partner at <a href=\"https://alley.co/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Alley Interactive</a>, said. &#8220;As one for-instance, how many urls are going to be in each paginated (sub-) sitemap? A sitemap index file is limited to 50,000 sitemaps, so even though each sitemap is limited to a maximum of 50,000 urls, generating 50,000 urls in one page request would be extremely difficult and non-performant to do on-the-fly.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Muller and other contributors on the project have a strategy for addressing scalability concerns and are planning to keep these considerations on the forefront while building core&#8217;s implementation.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As for everything else, engineering new features should always be done with security and performance in mind,&#8221; Muller said. &#8220;It starts at the high level architecture down to the granular details. Each Sitemap entry will only contain ,  and  which should not overload the server request with a paginated approach. The number of entries per Sitemap is still to be defined, performance will definitely be a deciding factor.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The XML Sitemaps project has a clearly defined scope. The initial implementation will not include features like image, video, or news sitemaps. It also will not include a UI for controls to exclude individual posts, pages, or custom post types from the sitemap. This is somewhat controversial but plugins can always extend core to offer these features until a more sophisticated version of sitemaps lands in core.</p>\n<p>Plugin authors who offer XML sitemaps will need to re-architect their plugins with the new API in order to avoid conflicts and indexing errors. </p>\n<p>&#8220;I can confidently say that we will make it as smooth as possible and work with plugin authors to avoid conflicts,&#8221; Muller said. &#8220;If anything else, having XML Sitemaps as well as a Core API to extend it will make their lives easier &#8211; plugin authors will have a standard way to extend it.&#8221; </p>\n<p>This effort to get sitemaps added to WordPress core is not limited to those working at Google and Yoast. Muller encouraged authors of other XML sitemaps plugins to get involved or at least follow the project&#8217;s development to ensure their plugins are compatible once it is merged into core.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 19 Jun 2019 03:49:13 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:36;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:42:\"WPTavern: WordPress 5.2.2 Squashes 13 Bugs\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=90869\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-2-2-squashes-13-bugs\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1305:\"<p>WordPress 5.2.2 dubbed a short-cycle maintenance release is <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/06/wordpress-5-2-2-maintenance-release/\">available for download</a>.

Just Tadlock has <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2019/06/07/proposal-theme-feature-repositories/\">proposed a idea</a> he calls Theme Feature Repositories. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea is to create standardized packages on the <a href=\"https://github.com/WPTRT\">Theme Review Team GitHub</a> repo that authors could use in their themes. If enough people bought into the idea and worked together, it would lessen the pain points between reviewers and theme authors. It would also decrease the amount of code written by hundreds of different authors to solve a common problem. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tadlock used Admin notices and Links to &#8216;Pro&#8217; versions as two examples that could benefit from this approach. Packages would handle specific use cases and be installed using Composer. For those who don&#8217;t use composer, an autoloader would be provided as well as a .zip file that could be dropped into a theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tadlock is asking the theme community what packages do they need or what common problems could be solved together. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This can literally be any common feature in WordPress themes, not just admin or customizer-related things,&#8221; Tadlock said. &#8220;Nothing is &#8216;out of bounds&#8217;. Every idea is on the table right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This is an ambitious project.  Itâ€™d require cooperation between authors and reviewers for the betterment of the theme directory as a whole. Itâ€™ll only work if we have buy-in from everyone.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tadlock also mentioned that due to his schedule, he will be unable to lead or co-lead the project and is seeking people interested in taking on these roles. Those interested should have knowledge of Git, Composer, and Object-oriented programming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in this project or want to provide feedback, you can leave a comment on <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2019/06/07/proposal-theme-feature-repositories/\">the proposal</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 13 Jun 2019 21:07:10 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:40;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:106:\"WPTavern: WordPress Spanish Translation Team Now has Meta Sites, Apps, and Top 200 Plugins 100% Translated\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=90804\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:114:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-spanish-translation-team-now-has-meta-sites-apps-and-top-200-plugins-100-translated\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5640:\"<p>The Spanish WordPress community hit a remarkable milestone with translations this week.

According to stats Naoko Takano shared at <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-translation-day-4-successfully-hosts-77-local-events-in-35-countries-recruits-183-new-translators\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress Translation Day 4</a> last month, Spanish is the locale with the most translation contributors (2,863), followed by German (2,399), Italian (2,190), Dutch (1,584), and Russian (1,515). It is also one of the top non-English locales installed, with 5.0% of all WordPress sites using the translation. WordPress.com <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/activity/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">reports</a> similar numbers, where Spanish is the second most popular language for blogs at 4.7%.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/_dorsvenabili/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">RocÃ­o Valdivia</a>, a Community Wrangler at WordCamp Central who lives in Spain, gave us a look at what is behind the team&#8217;s extraordinary growth and momentum. She identified several key factors that have contributed to their success in working efficiently and sharing useful information among team members during the past 2-3 years.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We created a Slack instance some years ago, but at the beginning it was common for people to join and ask for support questions,&#8221; Valdivia said. &#8220;Now we have some protocols: the general channel is an only-read channel. If someone ask for support, we send them with a kind predef to the <a href=\"https://es.wordpress.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">es.wordpress.org</a> forums, where they get answers in a few hours. There are no questions in the forums waiting for longer than six hours ever, as we have a very active support team that coordinates in the #support channel of our Slack.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Valdivia said that removing the noise of support requests has given the team very productive channels for translations, plugin and theme translations, meetups (where Meetup organizers share tips and resources using a shared Google drive folder), and WordCamps (where WC organizers share info, tips, answer questions in Spanish, and share resources like email templates.)</p>\n<p>&#8220;Besides all of this, weâ€™ve worked very well passing the philosophy of the project to the new members from the most experienced ones,&#8221; Valdivia said. &#8220;For example, people do very soft transitions from one lead organizer to the next one.&#8221; </p>\n<p>Although some WordCamp attendees have complained in the past that not much is accomplished at Contributor Days, the Spanish community has had success using these opportunities to transfer knowledge to new leaders and contributors. The community hosted 10 WordCamps in 2018 and Valdivia estimates they will have 9-10 in 2019. WordCamp Barcelona 2018 and 2019 had 400 attendees and 180 people at their Contributor Days. WC Irun 2019 had 220 attendees and 100 participants at Contributor Day. WordCamp Madrid 2019 sold out with 600 attendees and approximately 200 participated in Contributor Day.</p>\n<p>Although the Spanish community has experienced contributors across several WordPress.org teams, such as WPTV, Community, Support, and Polyglots, Valdivia said they are a bit thin on Core contributors.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Weâ€™re lacking people with experience contributing frequently to Core,&#8221; Valdivia said. &#8220;We have some of them who have contributed several times, but still need more people with more involvement to be able to pass all this info to newcomers.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Strong local meetups are another factor in the Spanish community&#8217;s success at keeping translations up-to-date. In addition to the largest team of translators in the world of WordPress, Spain has the <a href=\"https://central.wordcamp.org/reports/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">second highest number of meetup groups</a> and events per month. Spain is running 64 local meetups, with a population of 46 million people, compared to 201 groups in the U.S., which has 7x the population size (327 million).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screen-Shot-2019-06-13-at-2.20.46-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;The language barrier has been an issue for years, as not everyone speaks English and not everyone feels confident following conversations in English,&#8221; Valdivia said. &#8220;So, being able to train our own teams of contributors in our own language and having our own shared resources and channels, has been very useful.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 13 Jun 2019 20:22:57 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:41;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:105:\"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 356 â€“ Gutenberg, Governance, and Contributing to WordPress with Jonny Harris\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:59:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=90817&preview=true&preview_id=90817\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:110:\"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-356-gutenberg-governance-and-contributing-to-wordpress-with-jonny-harris\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1955:\"<p>In this episode, <a href=\"http://jjj.me\">John James Jacoby</a> and I are joined by <a href=\"https://www.spacedmonkey.com/\">Jonny Harris</a>.

Schott&#8217;s mission with Pika is &#8220;to make modern JavaScript more accessible by making it easier to find, publish, install, and use modern packages on npm.&#8221; Pika provides a searchable catalog of &#8220;module&#8221; packages available on npm &#8211; packages that use the more compact ES module syntax (ESM), which result in smaller Javascript bundles. </p>\n<p>npm currently lists <a href=\"https://www.pika.dev/about/stats\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">59,851 ES modules</a>. This makes up approximately 7% of total packages on npm are exporting an ES module, but the number is steadily increasing: </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screen-Shot-2019-06-13-at-9.13.09-AM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Pika makes it easy to search for these packages and the results will only include those that have a defined &#8220;module&#8221; entry point in their package.json manifest. Each listing consolidates the relevant information on one page, highlighting the important details.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screen-Shot-2019-06-13-at-9.26.36-AM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>One of the chief advantages of using ES modules is that they run natively on the web, without the need for a bundler. In a post titled &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.pikapkg.com/blog/pika-web-a-future-without-webpack\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">A Future Without Webpack</a>,&#8221; Schott contends that JavaScript developers are &#8220;so steeped in the world of bundlers&#8221; that they overlook the possibilities of using ESM dependencies that run directly on the web:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Over the last several years, JavaScript bundling has morphed from a production-only optimization into a required build step for most web applications. Whether you love this or hate it, itâ€™s hard to deny that bundlers have added a ton of new complexity to web development â€“ a field of development that has always taken pride in its view-source, easy-to-get-started ethos.</p>\n<p>@pika/web is an attempt to free web development from the bundler requirement. In 2019, you should use a bundler because you want to, not because you need to.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Schott created <a href=\"https://github.com/pikapkg/web\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> @pika/web</a> to make it easy for developers to use ES modules, even when they don&#8217;t have compatible dependencies. It provides an install-time tool that is not exactly a build tool or a bundler but works to output web-native npm dependencies into a single ESM .js file:</p>\n<blockquote><p>@pika/web checks your package.json manifest for any &#8220;dependencies&#8221; that export a valid ESM â€œmoduleâ€ entry point, and then installs them to a local web_modules/ directory. @pika/web works on any ESM package, even ones with ESM &#038; Common.js internal dependencies.</p>\n<p>Installed packages run in the browser because @pika/web bundles each package into a single, web-ready ESM .js file. For example: The entire â€œpreactâ€ package is installed to web_modules/preact.js. This takes care of anything bad that the package may be doing internally, while preserving the original package interface.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a demo of how that works:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"es\" dir=\"ltr\">Â¡OJO con @pika/web! <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f440.png\" alt=\"ðŸ‘€\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/26a1.png\" alt=\"âš¡\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f4e6.png\" alt=\"ðŸ“¦\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Instala tus dependencias npm y Ãºsalas directamente en el navegador.<br /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2728.png\" alt=\"âœ¨\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Sin bundlers, ni configuraciones de ningÃºn tipo.<br /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/26a1.png\" alt=\"âš¡\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Nativo, ESM, optimizado para http2&#8230; Â¡y MUY rÃ¡pido!</p>\n<p>Â¡Muy pronto, vÃ­deo mÃ¡s completo y artÃ­culo en <a href=\"https://t.co/uc7bPEkbXB\">https://t.co/uc7bPEkbXB</a> <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f468-200d-1f4bb.png\" alt=\"ðŸ‘¨â€ðŸ’»\" class=\"wp-smiley\" />! <a href=\"https://t.co/cdNWqBnrDc\">pic.twitter.com/cdNWqBnrDc</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Miguel Ãngel DurÃ¡n <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f468-200d-1f4bb.png\" alt=\"ðŸ‘¨â€ðŸ’»\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> (@midudev) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/midudev/status/1101828172390248448?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 2, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>This week Schott announced the availability of a new <a href=\"https://www.pika.dev/cdn\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Pika CDN</a> for delivering modern ES module packages. It uses the <a href=\"https://github.com/pikapkg/web\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">pikapkg/web package builder</a> to work with any ESM package and the CDN will automagically  handle any non-ESM dependencies of that package. Pika CDN automatically detects the visitor&#8217;s browser and serves JS that is optimized to the environment, eliminating polyfills and transpiler bloat wherever possible. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Screen-Shot-2019-06-13-at-10.12.32-AM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;Pika CDN leverages your browser&#8217;s natural caching abilities to give your pages faster dependency load times, especially on first visit,&#8221; Schott said. &#8220;0ms first-loads are even possible (for your dependencies at least) if all packages have been seen before.</p>\n<p>&#8220;With our CDN, package authors can distribute more modern, unminified packages without worrying about how to serve them directly. Instead, our nifty package-builder automatically resolves each package &#8212; and any legacy sub-dependencies &#8212; into a single, minified, ready-to-import JavaScript file.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Schott recently left his position at Ripple to work full-time on Pika, a project that he believes will move the JavaScript ecosystem forward. </p>\n<p>&#8220;Leaving my team was one of the hardest decisions I&#8217;ve ever made, but I know that I&#8217;m needed here,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m so excited to be a part of the future of the web, whatever it ends up looking like.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Pika is looking for corporate sponsors.

Especially when it first came to video and they could watch it every dayâ€¦ or two or three times a day if mom wasnâ€™t feeling good or catching up on sleep from being up with baby brother the night before.</p>\n<p>Thereâ€™s this strange part of that movie where Moana follows Maui to a place under the ocean called â€œThe Realm of Monsters.â€ Itâ€™s where monsters go after being killed. If you have younger kids, you know what I&#8217;m talking about. If you donâ€™t have kids, itâ€™s when the giant crab sings the song â€œShiny.â€</p>\n<p><img /></p>\n<p>One common theme in myths, legends, and ancient religious writings, is where the hero visits the underworld, aka â€œafterlifeâ€ or â€œhell.â€ There they experience a symbolic or actual death for themselves or a loved one. Often through conquering a monster who is the Lord of the Underworld, they then re-emerge with their loved one, new knowledge and power, and/or some object to help them on their quest.</p>\n<p>The film Moana clearly plays out this theme. She and Maui emerge triumphant from the realm of monsters, having defeated the giant crab by flipping it on its back and retrieving Mauiâ€™s magical hook.</p>\n<p>In Return of the Jedi, Luke descends to the underworld of Jabba&#8217;s Palace. There, heâ€™s able to bring his friend Han Solo back from a virtual death, defeat the Rancor, kill Jabba the Hut (lord of the criminal underworld), save the princess, and retrieve his lightsaber. All this happens before we see even one single, fuzzy, cute, unblinking Ewokâ€¦. Unless you believe in the â€œspecial editions,â€ in which case the Ewoks blink.</p>\n<p><img /></p>\n<p>There are many movies, books, stories, mythologies, etc that all follow similar patterns.</p>\n<p>Like Mauiâ€™s hook or Lukeâ€™s lightsaber, in these stories the hero often emerges from the underworld with newfound knowledge and/or a powerful object. Briefly, Iâ€™d like to take you on my own personal â€œHeroâ€™s Journeyâ€ to the dark underworld of WordPress hosting. Along with it my quest of building a business on WordPress and hosting, with its own mythical monsters to slay, trials to be conquered, riddles to be solved, and ultimately new knowledge and weapons gained.</p>\n<h3>The Call to Adventure</h3>\n<p>In the early days of my business, Fiddler Online (<a href=\"https://wordx.press/what-the-change-to-wordxpress-means-for-our-members/\">now called WordXpress</a>), I envisioned building websites for companies on WordPress, then charging a monthly fee to maintain, support, edit, update, and manage them. I got started with a few clients and wanted to grow.</p>\n<p>Iâ€™d trusted someone to set me up with a very inexpensive VPS on unmanaged hosting. He was supposed to do the managing and ensure it all ran smoothly. I quickly learned you get what you pay for! Soon our membersâ€™ sites started going offline, usually all at once as the VPS crashed from one problem or another. It wasnâ€™t just the server being down that caused problems. It was also corrupting data and other strange and scary things that Iâ€™d never encountered before, such as the body content of posts and pages being cut off, starting with the first special character that appeared in the content (a database issue).</p>\n<p><img /></p>\n<p>These were dark and scary monsters to battle. I knew cPanel pretty well, but the APACHE stack that ran beneath it was mostly a mystery to me. So was database encoding and other advanced technical realms that all have an impact on the server, WordPress, and ultimately our clientsâ€™ businesses.</p>\n<p>The monsters appeared, seemingly determined to kill my small and struggling business, shortly after the birth of our first child. I was frequently up all night working with â€œToddâ€ the server guy (weâ€™ll call him) to try and get the websites back online. Weâ€™d vanquish one monster, rest a day or so, and find another had taken some sites down again.</p>\n<p>After a few weeks of constant frustration, I said â€œenoughâ€ and signed up for a Hostgator reseller plan. This was back when they were an independent hosting company. On this new plan I could install as many cPanelâ€™s as I needed and manage each separately! I thought it was wonderful and would solve all my problems. Hostgator transferred all our sites from the terrible VPS hosting weâ€™d been on to their servers and I thought perhaps that was it!</p>\n<blockquote><p>I thought my quest was over. Iâ€™d fought the monsters and won.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Scary as it was, it had been relatively brief. Iâ€™d learned a lot, but felt like Iâ€™d been to the underworld and back!</p>\n<h3>The Illusion of Safety</h3>\n<p>Unfortunately, the wraiths had cast a spell over me, blinding me to the fact that they were still lurking in the shadows. When transferring our WordPress websites to our new account, Hostgator had copied each entire cPanel over from the VPS. This eliminated the underlying problems in the APACHE stack on that horrible VPS, but brought with it the fiends that had infiltrated cPanel and even our WordPress websites. To be clear: they werenâ€™t infected with any kind of malware, but configuration problems, cruft, and who knows what else, caused some really bad results.</p>\n<p>With my new spellbound, but misled confidence, I pushed our business forward. I brought on a business partner, Kurt as the sales guy. Later we acquired another website company. Through all that, weâ€™d learned a lot, and doing okay for that stage, but still struggled financially as we bootstrapped this new business from nothing.</p>\n<blockquote><p>When we acquired this other business, theyâ€™d been running all their clientâ€™s sites on WordPress Multisite. It seemed like a great idea because of how it allowed us to manage all the websites in one place.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Despite the progress the business made, the monstrosities emerged again and this time with higher stakes since our business had grown and was now managing many more websites. These monsters emerged partly from what had been transferred over with cPanel, and the difficulties of running a large Multisite where each child site had its own theme, plus the weight of adding more and more websites and traffic to hosting that was really just shared hosting with WHM access and more control.</p>\n<p><img /></p>\n<h3>The Plunge Into the Underworld</h3>\n<p>In each heroâ€™s journey, thereâ€™s often a wizard or goddess that helps guide and mentor the hero along his journey. I eventually made friends with a great guy weâ€™ll call Sam. He ran his own hosting company with data centers and a great support staff. Sam was somewhat like Obi-Wan, Merlin, or Maui in these stories: he was my mentor and companion on my adventures into the underworld that followed. He made a great guide, because heâ€™d been there before. Unfortunately, his own journey had never taken him to some of the deepest darkest places we would soon encounter.</p>\n<p>So we moved to Samâ€™s hosting, where he kindly watched things closely and provided a server adminâ€™s perspective and advice at a much lower price than he would have normally charged.</p>\n<p>It wasnâ€™t long before the demons, wraiths, monsters, and other ghouls started crawling from the darkness. It started with random downtime. Then followed strange limitations on websites. Next emails were not getting delivered. Then it was slowness. Now we were hackedâ€¦ or were we? Suddenly all the contents of all pages and posts were cut off (we thought we killed this monster before)! Then email wasnâ€™t being sent. Next our server is sending spam email. Now a hard drive is dying. It just kept going and going. Many of these demons were completely new to Sam and his very experienced team.</p>\n<p>It didnâ€™t take long before there were whisperings of â€œthe Fiddler curse.â€ This curse referred to Fiddler Online the name of our company. The hosting support team joked that we were cursed. All kinds of issues arose that theyâ€™d never seen before, and with a frequency theyâ€™d never experienced either.</p>\n<p>When a car crashed into the data centerâ€™s power regulation center during a freak storm, it cut off power from the normal power lines, as well as from their automatic backup power supply! It completely took the data center offline. The â€œFiddler curseâ€ was in full force.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Or put better, we were in the deepest, darkest, part of the underworld, locked in an all-out battle with the worst demons and wraiths it had to send against us.</p></blockquote>\n<p>We tried method after method to defeat the monsters. We tried rebuilding the server stacks. We tried various WordPress optimizations. We bought our own server and had it installed in their data center. We even tried a totally different Linux stack and something called Interworx, a cPanel alternative, that came with load balancing and real-time backup. But no matter how much money, time, and knowledge we threw at it, the issues continued. No matter how many monsters we slew, we were still losing the war.</p>\n<h3>The â€œReal Worldâ€ Dragons</h3>\n<p>When I recently asked my wife Jill about that time of our lives, she said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>â€œFrom my perspective, it was hard to know when to throw in the towel and say â€˜enoughâ€™ because itâ€™s just not working. Getting the hosting sorted out totally changed the entire dynamic and perspective of doing our own business. Before that, it felt like we were building a dream on a crumbling foundation.â€</p></blockquote>\n<p><img /></p>\n<p>And donâ€™t get the wrong idea from this image. Jill was no damsel in distress. Sheâ€™s a warrior too. Iâ€™d have never completed this quest without her there, fighting alongside me. She may have not fought the technical fiends, but there were plenty other monsters in the form of financial struggles, moves, and difficult situations that arose from my unavailability, our lack of money, and more.</p>\n<p>This was all a lot like battling the Hydra of Lerna: weâ€™d cut off one head, and two would grow back in its place. Weâ€™d take a breather for a week, and then here came the wraiths!</p>\n<p>The stress of it all exacerbated a gallstone problem I had. Because of a misdiagnosis, I thought it was something there was no solution for. So even when I wasnâ€™t up in the middle of the night battling monsters demons of the hosting underworld with Sam, I was often awake at night in massive amounts of pain as my gallbladder tried to pass gigantic gallstones. So even then, Iâ€™d be sleeping the next day when I needed to be designing websites or networking.</p>\n<p>Throw in a healthy dose of anxiety and some intermittent depression and you get the picture. Instead of growing, our business stagnated. The quest through this dark underworld seemed to have no end in sight. It ruined vacations, stole away family time, punished me physically, hurt our clientâ€™s business, and was pushing myself, Jill, and our finances, to our very limits.</p>\n<h3>Death and Rebirth</h3>\n<p>It all seemed to come to a head when the pain of my gallstones became so intense I thought I was going to die. After 2 visits to the Emergency Room and 3 days in the hospital, I gave birth to this baby. They actually saw a larger one than this in the ultrasound beforehand, but my body had apparently broken it up before they removed my gallbladder. I returned home with real-world wounds that would turn into scars, and lighter by one gallbladder and several massive gallstones.</p>\n<p><img /></p>\n<p>I left the hospital with a new lease on life. I felt like Iâ€™d been resurrected, fighting my way out of the underworld and back to the land of the living. It helped me open up to a completely different approach to hosting and allowed me to see that tiny speck of light that ended up being the doorway out of this underworld made up of the dark side of WordPress and hosting.</p>\n<p>I was able to use my newfound perspective to find some awesome new weapons, and fight my way to that exit. Luckily for you, you can learn from my pain and battles with the underworld.</p>\n<h3>The Road Back: Simplify</h3>\n<p>Illumination was mine! Of the knowledge I gained, one key principle stood out among the rest: <strong>make things as simple as possible, while avoiding single points of failure on mission-critical systems.</strong> Multisite was great for managing all the websites at once, but if one had a problem, they all went down! The same with having a single server to run all our sites: if the server went down, we had the urgency of 30 or 40 clients (back then) all being negatively impacted at once.</p>\n<p>We started by <a href=\"https://wordx.press/how-to-revert-a-wordpress-multisite-to-a-single-site/\">killing our Multisites</a> and traditional hosting setups. Instead of a single Multisite with 1 database where a problem could take down all the sites in the Multisite, we moved to individual WordPress installs for each site. As we pulled each site out of the Multisite and migrated it to our new cloud hosting, we also checked the databases and files thoroughly to ensure they were clean, light, and that we eliminated any cruft that had built up in the database. We also stopped running email and DNS through our web servers. This effectively killed the demons that had moved with us in previous hosting migrations.</p>\n<p>Hereâ€™s my recommended doâ€™s and don&#8217;ts for any smaller businesses hosting and maintaining WordPress websites:</p>\n<p><strong>Donâ€™t:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>use shared hosting or hosting that uses cPanel</li>\n<li>use Multisite (SPoF)</li>\n<li>put all your sites on 1 server (SPoF)</li>\n<li>use your web server as an email server</li>\n<li>send WordPress transactional emails from your webserver</li>\n<li>use your web server for DNS</li>\n<li>use your hosting company for domain registration</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Do:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>use cloud hosting with WordPress-optimized stack and custom control panel</li>\n<li>use a bulk-site-management tool</li>\n<li>spread your sites across multiple servers</li>\n<li>use an email suite (Hover, Zoho, G Suite, Office 365)</li>\n<li>use a transactional email service (SendGrid, Postmark, MailGun)</li>\n<li>use your registrar for DNS</li>\n<li>use a different registrar for registering domains, than your hosting</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Following these tips eliminates many single points of failure, simplifies things greatly, and gives you the tools and ability to go right to the source of the problem. Since all your important WordPress functionality isnâ€™t in one place with one point of failure, you can go where the problem is.</p>\n<p>For example, if a client isnâ€™t receiving WooCommerce new order emails from their website, we can quickly go to SendGrid to see why that is and what needs to be done to fix it in an easy to use interface. Try that on a traditional APACHE/cPanel setup that sends your clientâ€™s company emails, WordPress emails, etc. all from one place.</p>\n<p><img /></p>\n<h3>Cloud Hosting</h3>\n<p>We eliminated cPanel and the normal Linux hosting stacks by <a href=\"https://www.cloudways.com/blog/tevya-wordxpress-success-story/\">moving to CloudWays</a>, which has a nice WordPress setup that they run on top of a number of cloud hosting services such as Google, Amazon, Digital Ocean, and Vultr. They have their own in-house customized stack and management dashboard. CloudWays removed all the normal bloat and potential for problems that comes with it, and really took away most of the pain, hassle, and responsibility of the hosting part of WordPress and for quite cheap.</p>\n<p>On CloudWays, instead of putting all 40+ sites on one server, we split them up, with about 15 &#8211; 18 sites on one small Digital Ocean (and later Vultr) server. This meant that if one site had issues, it wouldnâ€™t take down all our other sites. And even if the issue was bad enough to affect the whole server, or the server had its own issues, only a small portion of our clients would be affected at once.</p>\n<h3>Email Accounts and Transactional Email</h3>\n<p>Additionally, we stopped running email through our servers. Part of simplifying is outsourcing to people/services who can just do it better than you (or that old hosting youâ€™re clinging to because itâ€™s cheap). I love that good WordPress hosts like CloudWays, Flywheel, and Kinsta have no options for you to do this or include built-in services like SendGrid. I slew a lot of email monsters. Using something like SendGrid or Postmark for WordPress and G Suite or Office 365 for email accounts, eliminates tons of headaches.</p>\n<p>We set up WordPressâ€™s emails to go through SendGrid and all our membersâ€™ email accounts we migrated to Hover, Google Apps, or Office 365.</p>\n<h3>Bulk-WordPress Management</h3>\n<p>In place of Multisite, we found MainWP and chose it over other options like InfiniteWP. It provided us the bulk-control of Multisite, but without the single point of failure issue. The upside is that itâ€™s fairly inexpensive and runs on a WordPress install, so you control it on your hosting.</p>\n<p>Thatâ€™s kinda its downside as well. If something goes wrong, itâ€™s on my team and I to run the problem down and fix it. Or we have to go through the cumbersome process of reporting it to the MainWP support team, then providing them access to both the dashboard site and an affected child site. Eventually we decided to move to ManageWP because itâ€™s a hosted platform. That means when something goes wrong, much of the time, itâ€™s on them to fix, and they have access to fix their own platform, plus the logs, etc from our sites.</p>\n<p><strong>MainWP:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Inexpensive</li>\n<li>Runs on top of your WP install</li>\n<li>You maintain control</li>\n<li>Familiar interface</li>\n<li>Free to use the basics</li>\n<li>Lifetime extensions purchase option</li>\n<li>GPL licensed</li>\n<li>Great support</li>\n<li>Good community</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>ManageWP:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>More expensive</li>\n<li>Runs on their servers, so problems are largely theirs to deal with</li>\n<li>Less overall responsibility and time drain</li>\n<li>Free to use the basics</li>\n<li>Great support</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Master of Two Worlds of WordPress</h3>\n<p>Fortunately today there are many awesome hosting options and bulk-management tools that simply werenâ€™t available to me years ago when I started on this journey. After this last, final push, my team and I stood back and waited and rested, expecting more monsters. And occasionally one crawled out of itâ€™s hole. But by and large the underworld was defeated and left far behind. Moving to cloud hosting and simplifying were finally the spell that broke the Fiddler curse and freed us from the underworld. Our businessâ€™s core service was stable and safe and running like it should be. We could start growing again! It was such a relief!</p>\n<p>To reiterate some of the illumination gained on my journey: simplify your WordPress websites and hosting through offloading everything you can to experts who do it better, often for cheaper (if you properly calculate the value of your own time). Focus on your super-power whether it be design or development, or just creating solutions on WP with existing plugins and tools. If your super-power isnâ€™t WordPress at all, you can outsource maintenance, content updates, backups and security, plugin and core updates, and much more to a company like <a href=\"https://wordx.press\">WordXpress</a>. Iâ€™ve built this company based on the knowledge and tools I learned on my quest.</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: My &#8220;Hero&#8217;s Journey&#8221; Through the Dark Underworld of WordPress Hosting\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=My%20%22Hero%27s%20Journey%22%20Through%20the%20Dark%20Underworld%20of%20WordPress%20Hosting&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fmy-heros-journey-through-the-dark-underworld-of-wordpress-hosting%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: My &#8220;Hero&#8217;s Journey&#8221; Through the Dark Underworld of WordPress Hosting\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fmy-heros-journey-through-the-dark-underworld-of-wordpress-hosting%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fmy-heros-journey-through-the-dark-underworld-of-wordpress-hosting%2F&title=My+%26%238220%3BHero%26%238217%3Bs+Journey%26%238221%3B+Through+the+Dark+Underworld+of+WordPress+Hosting\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: My &#8220;Hero&#8217;s Journey&#8221; Through the Dark Underworld of WordPress Hosting\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/my-heros-journey-through-the-dark-underworld-of-wordpress-hosting/\" title=\"My &#8220;Hero&#8217;s Journey&#8221; Through the Dark Underworld of WordPress Hosting\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/my-heros-journey-through-the-dark-underworld-of-wordpress-hosting/\">My &#8220;Hero&#8217;s Journey&#8221; Through the Dark Underworld of WordPress Hosting</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 12 Jun 2019 12:00:34 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Tevya Washburn\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:45;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"WPTavern: Drupal Gutenberg 1.0 Released, Now Ready for Production Sites\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=90376\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"https://wptavern.com/drupal-gutenberg-1-0-released-now-ready-for-production-sites\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6201:\"<p>The <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/gutenberg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenberg module for Drupal</a>, created by <a href=\"https://www.frontkom.no/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Frontkom</a>, reached the 1.0 milestone earlier this month. It is the first stable release recommended for use in production with Drupal 8.x. </p>\n<p>The 1.0 release removes the Gutenberg-JS dependency and uses Gutenberg core files directly. It is based on Gutenberg <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/05/01/whats-new-in-gutenberg-1st-may/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">version 5.6.1</a>, which was released in early May. The module boasts better handling for media files, adding support for title, caption, and alternative text. It also adds an &#8220;Allowed Blocks UI&#8221; to the content type admin UI, so administrators can restrict which blocks show up in the block selector.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Weâ€™re now ready for production sites in the sense that weâ€™ll be more careful with structure changes, will try to do update paths when possible, and will create automated tests for crucial functionality,&#8221; Frontkom project manager Thor Andre Gretland said. &#8220;Weâ€™ve solved the blockers for a stable release.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Upgrading the module from RC-1 may require some extra steps, because it is a big jump, taking the Gutenberg library from 4.8.0 to 5.6.1. Users will need to update the database. It is also necessary to navigate to content types and click save to enable Gutenberg again so that it will begin storing the Allowed blocks in the database. If users get notices about invalid blocks, they are advised to try the Attempt Block Recovery option:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/attempt-block-recovery.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;Itâ€™s actually a rather large update,&#8221; Gretland said. &#8220;We were planning to add a couple of last needed features to release our 1.0 version, but ended up using the latest Gutenberg version with several new great features. Weâ€™re also using more of the Gutenberg Core, that weâ€™ve been able to use before.&#8221; </p>\n<p>The module still has one critical issue that Frontkom is working on. <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/gutenberg/issues/3059167\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Reusable blocks are not working</a> with the latest release. Users are getting a &#8220;this block is unavailable or deleted&#8221; message when attempting to insert a reusable block. In the meantime, those who require this feature can roll back to RC1 to get it working again.</p>\n<p>So far the Gutenberg module has been well-received. It has been downloaded more than 12,000 times and 494 sites are reported to be using it.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Setup <a href=\"https://twitter.com/drupalgutenberg?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@drupalgutenberg</a> on D8 yesterday (following meeting one of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/frontkom?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@frontkom</a> at the recent Dutch <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/CiviCRM?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#CiviCRM</a> sprint) and was pretty blown away.

Although the library has been slow to gain contributors, it does contain several blocks that are helpful for creating page layouts, such as Content in Columns, Hero Section, Section Wrapper, Section Row, and a Feature Box block. Site administrators can also use the Gutenberg module in combination with Drupal&#8217;s new Layout Builder, which was introduced as a stable module to Drupal 8.7 core.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We see a valid use case for mixing Drupal Gutenberg with the Drupal layout builder when you might want to create layout templates with the layout builder, and keep the actual content editing in Gutenberg,&#8221; Gretland said. &#8220;For example you could use the layout builder to define fixed byline elements for author and create date, but leave the actual content creation experience to Gutenberg.&#8221;</p>\n<p>There are a few limitations to using the two tools together. The only way to use them on the same project is if they deal with different content types.  </p>\n<p>&#8220;Since Drupal Gutenberg takes over the whole node UI, it can have some unexpected effects when used together with Layout Builder,&#8221; Gretland said. &#8220;That doesnâ€™t mean that they wonâ€™t ever &#8216;work&#8217; together. One idea could be using the LB data structure to generate Gutenberg fixed layouts/templates and even save Gutenberg data in a structured way handled by Layout Builder.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Gretland said his team believes Gutenberg delivers a better editing experience than Layout Builder, as it is a more mature project. However, Layout Builder stores its data in a structured way, which has its advantages and disadvantages over Gutenberg.</p>\n<p>WebWash has a good <a href=\"https://www.webwash.net/create-pages-using-gutenberg-wordpress-editor-in-drupal/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">video tutorial</a> for Drupal users who want to learn how to configure the Gutenberg module and use it on the Page content type.

DevKit gives me the power to do that.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stallings added, &#8220;We wanted to build a kick ass set of tools for developers building on WP Engine. Thatâ€™s been our mission from the start, build something that all developers want to use (including us)!&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As what for what sets DevKit apart from the others, &#8220;I think our architecture is very different from both tools,&#8221; Stallings said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Similar to Docker Engine, DevKit CLI is the interface to DevKit. So when we build the GUI it will 100% complement the CLI, and the two can be used interchangeably. This will enable us to build other interfaces in the future too.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DevKit provides the following features:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Container-based local development environment</li><li>SSH Gateway access</li><li>Push and pull deployments to WP Engine</li><li>Preview your local site with others via ngrok</li><li>PHP version selector</li><li>Email testing client</li><li>MySQL</li><li>Local SSH &amp; WP-CLI</li><li>Genesis Framework WP-CLI commands</li><li>phpmyadmin</li><li>webgrind</li><li>Varnish</li><li>HTTPS Proxy</li><li>xdebug</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, DevKit&#8217;s user interface is command line only with plans to add a GUI later this year. It&#8217;s available for free and is in open beta for Mac and Linux. Those interested in participating in the open beta can sign up on the <a href=\"https://wpengine.com/devkit/\">DevKit landing page</a>. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 11 Jun 2019 20:12:43 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:83:\"WPTavern: Former npm, Inc.

Although centralization has some advantages for usability and reliability, success can be expensive when a centralized service becomes popular. She described the events leading up to npm&#8217;s incorporation in 2013. The registry was down more than it was up in October 2013 and npm needed money.</p>\n<p>npm&#8217;s owner took seed funding from a VC firm and the Node project continued to give npm special privileges. Developers perpetuated this by continuing to use npm, as over time it had come to define developers&#8217; expectations in serving JavaScript packages. Silverio discusses some of the consequences of npm coming under private control, how developers now have no input into registry policies or how disputes are resolved. </p>\n<p>Presumably speaking from her intimate knowledge of the company&#8217;s inner workings, Silverio describes how VC-funding turned npm Inc. into a financial instrument.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Financial instruments are contracts about money,&#8221; she said. &#8220;npm Inc, the company that owns our language ecosystem, is a thing that might as well be a collection of pork bellies, as far as its owners are concerned. They make contracts with each other and trade bits of it around. npm Inc. is a means for turning money into more money.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Silverio contends that JavaScript&#8217;s package registry should not be privately controlled and that centralization is a burden that will inevitably lead to private control because the servers cost money. </p>\n<p>Her sharp criticism of centralized package management leads into her announcement of a federated, decentralized package registry called <a href=\"https://github.com/entropic-dev\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Entropic</a> that she created with former npm colleague Chris Dickinson and more than a dozen contributors. The project is Apache 2.0 licensed and its creators are working in cooperation with the <a href=\"https://openjsf.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">OpenJS Foundation</a>. </p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Warming my heart right now: how many former npm-ers are contributing to entropic &lt;3</p>\n<p>&mdash; Ceej is on vacation (@ceejbot) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ceejbot/status/1136551537835032577?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 6, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Entropic comes with its own CLI, and offers a new file-centric publication API. All packages published to the registry are public and developers are encouraged to use something like the GitHub Package Registry if they need to control access to packages. The project is just over a month old and is not ready for use. </p>\n<p>&#8220;I think itâ€™s right that the pendulum is swinging away from centralization and I want to lend my push to the swing,&#8221; Silverio said. The last decade has been about consolidation and monolithic services, but the coming decade is going to be federated. Federation spreads out costs. It spreads out control. It spreads out policy-making. It hands control of your slice of our language ecosystem to you. My hope is that by giving Entropic away, Iâ€™ll help us take our language commons back.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Silverio&#8217;s <a href=\"https://github.com/ceejbot/economics-of-package-management/blob/master/essay.md\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Economics of Package Management</a> essay is available on GitHub. Check out the video of the presentation from JSConf EU below. If decentralized package management gains momentum and becomes the standard for the industry, this video captures what may become a turning point in the JavaScript ecosystem and a defining moment for the future of the web.</p>\n<p></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 11 Jun 2019 03:41:06 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:48;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"WPTavern: BuddyPress 5.0 to Update Password Control to Match WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=90023\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"https://wptavern.com/buddypress-5-0-to-update-password-control-to-match-wordpress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3462:\"<p>BuddyPress 5.0 development began in December 2018 after <a href=\"https://buddypress.org/2018/11/buddypress-4-0-0-pequod/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">4.0.0 was released</a> in November. The core BuddyPress team has not published a roadmap for what will be coming in 5.0, but features and fixes added so far can be found on GitHub in the <a href=\"https://github.com/buddypress/BuddyPress/commits/master\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">commit log</a>. </p>\n<p>One noteworthy addition to the upcoming major release is that the BP Nouveau template pack is being <a href=\"https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/12397\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">updated to use the same password control as the one used in WordPress core</a>. BuddyPress users will now be able to set their passwords using WordPress&#8217; interface on the registration page and on the user&#8217;s general settings page. </p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what it will look like in the templates:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Here\'s how it looks <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f4fd.png\" alt=\"ðŸ“½\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> <a href=\"https://t.co/g8DknNpUKl\">pic.twitter.com/g8DknNpUKl</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; imath (@imath) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/imath/status/1129668922024845313?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 18, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>By default, BuddyPress will generate a strong password, but the user can still edit it, if necessary.

As a result of the password control update, the src/bp-templates/bp-nouveau/js/password-verify.js template is scheduled to be deprecated and deleted in BuddyPress 6.0.0, so developers will want to take note if using the bp-nouveau-password-verify script as a dependency for custom password control implementations.</p>\n<p>BuddyPress 5.0 also <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/buddypress-5-0-to-display-debug-info-in-the-new-site-health-info-screen\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">adds BP-specific debug into to the Site Health Info screen</a> that was introduced in WordPress 5.2.

But, this is an extremely powerful feature that Iâ€™m sure will become more useful in the future. I can even see things like theme authors sharing reusable blocks to help users build out certain page designs.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing other people share their reusable blocks or templates. One of the beautiful things about the new editor is that it doesn&#8217;t require a developer to sort blocks into a particular layout and then save it as a reusable block that can be shared.</p>\n<h2>C02 May Be the Cause of Feeling Drowsy During Conference Sessions</h2>\n<p>I always thought it had something to do with lunch but I&#8217;ve felt drowsy before then.
